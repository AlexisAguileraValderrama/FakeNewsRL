ban public schools and private businesses from inflicting “discomfort” on white people during lessons or training about discrimination.\\n By Bess LevinJanuary 21, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailSave StoryFacebookTwitterEmailSave StoryQuick question for the group: Despite constantly claiming liberals are easily “triggered” “snowflakes,” are Republicans actually the most ridiculously sensitive people on earth?\\n So much so that they can’t stand the idea of factually accurate conversations about race in this country that might paint white people in an uncomfortable light?\\n And are now going so far as to try to effectively ban said conversations, because sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling “LA LA LA LA CAN’T HEAR YOU” when the topic comes up isn’t working?\\n If you’re unsure, let us clear it up for you: The answer is hell yes.\\n On Tuesday, a bill backed by Florida governor Ron DeSantis that would prohibit public schools and private businesses from inflicting “discomfort” on white people during lessons or training about discrimination was approved by the state’s Senate Education Committee, its first hurdle before becoming a law.\\n The bill, SB 148, seemingly grew out of the conservative hysteria over “critical race theory,”\\xa0which, as a reminder, is an academic concept based on the idea that racism is not about individual people’s prejudices but about institutions and policies.\\n It does not, as GOP lawmakers and their partners in the right\\nwing media would have us believe, teach that all white people are racist.\\n (As another reminder, teaching CRT is not actually being required in elementary, middle, or high schools, but you wouldn’t know that by watching Fox News, which would have viewers believe that teachers are telling white kindergarteners to turn over their allowance as reparations.)\\n The bill, sponsored by State Senator Manny Diaz Jr., reads, in part, “An individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, does not bear responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex.\\n An individual should not be made to feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race.”THE\\n HIVE NEWSLETTERDaily updates from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley.\\n Your emailSUBMITBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie StatementDemocrats have argued that such a bill would lead to frivolous lawsuits and basically equate to censorship.\\n When asked for real\\nlife examples of schools or businesses telling students or employees that they are inherently racist because of the color of their skin, their Republican counterparts could come up with none.\\n “This bill\\'s not for Blacks, this bill was not for any other race,” said State Senator Shevrin Jones.\\n “This was directed to make whites not feel bad about what happened years ago.\\n At no point did anyone say white people should be held responsible for what happened, but what I would ask my white counterparts is, are you an enabler of what happened, or are you going to say we must talk about history?”\\n At a news conference last month, DeSantis, who has designs on the White House in 2024, called critical race theory “crap” and vowed to pass legislation allowing parents to sue schools and employees to sue employers if they are made to listen to such a thing.\\n Asked for comment by CBS News, the governor’s spokeswoman reiterated DeSantis’s embarrassing comments from the same news conference in which he suggested that Martin Luther King Jr. would be all for these Republican bills.\\n “You think about what MLK stood for.\\n He said he didn’t want people judged on the color of their skin but on the content of their character,” DeSantis said at the time.\\n “You listen to some of these people nowadays, they don’t talk about that.“\\n (Naturally, the governor, like other MLK\\nquoting Republicans, chose not to focus on the fact that King regularly reminded America of its racist roots and said things\\xa0like, “The Republican Party geared its appeal and program to racism, reaction, and extremism.\\n ”)Anyway, as MSNBC’s Ja’han Jones notes, this whole bill is about “prioritizing white hypersensitivity over truthful teachings” and saying “lessons about America’s racist and sexist past are acceptable only if they don’t offend white people.”\\n And, according to Jones, it’s nothing new!To me, these new demands for fealty to fragile whiteness sound like a re\\nup of the Black Codes, laws instituted during and after the Civil War to reinforce white supremacy.\\n In some states, the codes\\xa0permitted capital punishment against Black people for minor crimes like petty theft, allowed whippings for vagrancy and swearing, and banned Black land ownership.\\n Florida’s particularly harsh codes allowed white people to beat Black workers for “disrespect,” as historian Jerrell H. Shofner\\xa0wrote\\xa0in his 1976 essay on the state’s racist laws.\\n Historian Joe M. Richardson wrote that white Floridians passed the codes out of fear that their racist world was crumbling around them.\\xa0\\n It seems\\xa0DeSantis and Florida’s GOP\\nled legislature are operating with a similar fear.\\n They see the facade of white supremacy—weak as it is—crumbling under the weight of high school lesson plans and workplace trainings.\\n And bills like SB 148 are sad attempts to piece that facade back together....\\n That’s why—if the\\xa0white parents complaining about Black authors\\xa0weren’t enough—it’s clear that the Florida bill is designed to coddle white people, even though it doesn’t mention them specifically.\\xa0\\n Most PopularThe Idaho Murders, Part 1: How 4 College Kids Lived and LovedBy Kathleen HaleGrammys 2023 Red Carpet: All the Fashion, Outfits,

Seth’s murder, says that Seth Rich’s father confirmed to him that he\\xa0“knew what his son did.”\\nBYPASS THE CENSORS\\nSign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox.\\n\\n Email*.NameThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\\n\\n By subscribing you agree to our Terms of Use.Thegatewaypundit.com reports: Butowsky further stated that the family was deeply concerned with their son being remembered for helping to get President Donald Trump elected.\\n\\n Speaking to Butowsky by phone on Thursday evening, he told the Gateway Pundit that during a conversation with Joel Rich on December 17, 2016 at 3:17 p.m., the father stated “we know what our sons did, but we just want to find Seth’s killer.”\\n\\n “They know — we all know,”\\xa0Butowksy said.\\n\\n In an audio recording that I previously obtained, private investigator Rod Wheeler explained that Seth’s brother, Aaron Rich, had tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth’s computer — even though there could be evidence on it.\\n\\n Wheeler said that Seth’s girlfriend told him that Aaron Rich had possession of Seth’s cell phones, but Aaron denied it and said “we’re not going to worry about the cell phones.”\\nAaron also blocked Wheeler from finding out about who was at a party Seth attended the night of the murder.\\n\\n “All I want you to do is work on the botched robbery theory and that’s it,” Aaron told Wheeler, according to Wheeler’s claim on the audio.\\n Wheeler said that Seth’s father Joel “does not appear to have any hidden agenda.”\\n\\n “He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,” Wheeler said.\\n “I said, well can I look at it?…He said, what are you looking for?\\n I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone.\\n He said no, I already checked it.\\n Don’t worry about it.”\\nAaron Rich works for\\xa0Northrup Grumman, which was named as the fifth\\nlargest defense contractor in the world in 2015, as a lead software developer.\\n\\n “It’s not just hacking and defending, there’s a lot more to it,” a cyber software engineer at Northrup Grumman says in a video on the company’s website.\\n\\n An additional leaked phone conversation I previously obtained featured award winning journalist Sy Hersh confirming that Rich had made contact with WikiLeaks.\\n\\n “There are no DNC or Podesta emails that exist beyond May 21 or 22, last email from either one of those groups.\\n What the report says is that some time in late Spring… he makes contact with WikiLeaks, that’s in his computer,” he says.\\n “Anyway, they found what he had done is that he had submitted a series of documents — of emails, of juicy emails, from the DNC.”\\n\\n “All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I’m sure dozens of emails, and said ‘I want money.’\\n Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,” he said.\\n They got access to the DropBox.”\\nHersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him, and had shared the DropBox with trusted associates incase anything happened to him.\\n\\n “The word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that ‘if anything happens to me it’s not going to solve your problems,’” he added.\\n “WikiLeaks got access before he was killed.”.\\n Audio tape of Seymour Hersh discussing WikiLeaks DNC leaks and Seth Rich https:\\nt.co\\nSTp9u7Vtbn h\\nt @CassandraRules\\n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) August 1, 2017.In an email exchange that had been previously provided to me exclusively, Butowsky pleaded with Hersh to go to Congress with what he knew.\\n\\n “I am curious why you haven’t approached the house committee telling them what you were read by your FBI friend related to Seth Rich that you in turn read to me.\\n Based on all your work, it appears that you care about the truth.\\n Even though, as you said you couldn’t get a second, shouldn’t you tell them so they could use their powers to determine the truth?”\\n Butowsky asked.\\n\\n “ed –you have a lousy memory…i was not read anything by my fbi friend..\\n i have no firsthand information and i really wish you would stop telling others information that you think i have…please stop relaying information that you do not have right…and that i.have no reason to believe is accurate…” Hersh wrote.\\n\\n Desperate to find the truth about what happened, Bukowsky continues to plead with the journalist to go forward.\\n\\n “I know it isn’t first hand knowledge but you clearly said, my memory is perfect, that you had a friend at the FBI who read \\n told you what was in the file on Seth Rich and I wonder why you aren’t helping your country and sharing that information on who it was?”\\n Interestingly, a new report published on Thursday evening by the Washington Times also confirms that Rich had downloaded thousands of DNC emails.\\n\\n “Another aspect that needs to be uncovered is the FBI’s ‘denial’ that its cyber experts who share space with the D.C. Metro police department at Cleveland Avenue in the District, assisted in accessing data on Mr. Rich’s laptop.\\n Not likely.\\n Data on the laptop revealed that Mr. Rich downloaded thousands of DNC emails and was in touch with Wikileaks.\\n The file with evidence of what was on Mr. Rich’s laptop sits with the FBI in a co\\nshared space with the D.C. police department.\\n According to Ed Butowsky, an acquaintance of the family, in his discussions with Joel and Mary Rich, they confirmed that their son transmitted the DNC emails to Wikileaks,” the Washinton Times reported.\\n\\n Rich was shot in the back in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016, near his home while he was on the phone with his girlfriend — 12 days before the publication of the DNC emails by WikiLeaks.\\n The police initially ruled that it was a botched robbery — but his wallet, watch, and necklace were still on his person when he was discovered by police.\\n\\n The\\xa0report\\xa0from the Washington Times points out that “the same day Seth Rich was murdered, an FBI agent’s car was burglarized in the same vicinity.\\n Included in the FBI equipment stolen was a 40 caliber Glock 22.\\n D.C.\\n Metro police issued a press release, declaring that the theft of the FBI agent’s car occurred between 5 and 7 a.m. Two weeks later, the FBI changed the time of the theft to between 12 a.m. and 2 a.m. Was the FBI gun used to shoot Seth Rich?\\n Neither the FBI nor the Metro police will discuss.”\\nLast July, Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) — a 30 member group made up of well respected former experts from the National Security Administration, tech companies and other intelligence agencies put out a\\xa0report\\xa0asserting that the DNC emails came from a leak, not a hack.\\n\\n VIPS stated that “forensic studies of ‘Russian hacking’ into Democratic National Committee computers last year reveal that on July 5, 2016, data was leaked (not hacked) by a person with physical access to DNC computer.\\n After examining metadata from the “Guccifer 2.0” July 5, 2016 intrusion into the DNC server, independent cyber investigators have concluded that an insider copied DNC data onto an external storage device.”\\n\\n Additionally, the former intelligence operatives detail how the FBI neglected to perform any independent forensics on the original “Guccifer 2.0,” and assert that “the reason the U.S. government lacks conclusive evidence of a transfer of a ‘Russian hack’ to WikiLeaks is because there was no such transfer.”\\nAmong those who signed on to the report is William Binney, former NSA Technical Director for World Geopolitical & Military Analysis; Co\\nfounder of NSA’s Signals Intelligence Automation Research Center, Larry C Johnson, who is retired from the CIA & State Department, Kirk Wiebe, former Senior Analyst at SIGINT Automation Research Center of the NSA, and many more.\\n\\n WikiLeaks has offered a $20,000 reward for Rich’s murderer however, and has retweeted articles that asserted he was their source without providing any additional comment..About Latest Posts Sean Adl\\nTabatabai.\\n November 29, 2022\\n16.World War 3: Russia And Syria

misleading headline reporting that Rochester, Minnesota police had raided an Olive Garden restaurant \"where Obama’s Muslim refugees were\", only to make a\"DISTURBING find inside\":\\nThe Olive Garden is arguably one of America’s most beloved restaurant chains for their delicious dishes and comfortable family environment.\\n However, when Barack Obama’s Muslim refugees take over one of these eateries, it becomes the last place you ever want to be caught dining, and probably make you hate pasta for the rest of your life.\\n This is especially the case at one popular location that became customers’ worst nightmare after cops raided it and made a disturbing find inside.\\n ...\\n\\n Although there were three Muslim men who participated in the brutal lunch hour exchange of gunfire, one two have been caught and charged.\\n The third got away with it and is likely being harbored by fellow refugees until the urge to kill strikes again — which is only a matter of time.\\n\\n Rochester police Capt. John Sherwin told us by phone that authorities never raided an Olive Garden restaurant.\\n Instead, they arrested two men, Abdi Omar Abukar, 21, and Idris Abdillahi Haji\\nMohamed, 22, who are suspected of shooting at a third person while running through a parking lot shared by\\xa0an Olive Garden in Rochester..\\n Police believe the chase started at a nearby apartment complex.\\n Sherwin

ban public schools and private businesses from inflicting “discomfort” on white people during lessons or training about discrimination.\\n By Bess LevinJanuary 21, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailSave StoryFacebookTwitterEmailSave StoryQuick question for the group: Despite constantly claiming liberals are easily “triggered” “snowflakes,” are Republicans actually the most ridiculously sensitive people on earth?\\n So much so that they can’t stand the idea of factually accurate conversations about race in this country that might paint white people in an uncomfortable light?\\n On Tuesday, a bill backed by Florida governor Ron DeSantis that would prohibit public schools and private businesses from inflicting “discomfort” on white people during lessons or training about discrimination was approved by the state’s Senate Education Committee, its first hurdle before becoming a law.\\n The bill, SB 148, seemingly grew out of the conservative hysteria over “critical race theory,”\\xa0which, as a reminder, is an academic concept based on the idea that racism is not about individual people’s prejudices but about institutions and policies.\\n It does not, as GOP lawmakers and their partners in the right\\nwing media would have us believe, teach that all white people are racist.\\n (As another reminder, teaching CRT is not actually being required in elementary, middle, or high schools, but you wouldn’t know that by watching Fox News, which would have viewers believe that teachers are telling white kindergarteners to turn over their allowance as reparations.)\\n The bill, sponsored by State Senator Manny Diaz Jr., reads, in part, “An individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, does not bear responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex.\\n An individual should not be made to feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race.”THE\\n HIVE NEWSLETTERDaily updates from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley.\\n Your emailSUBMITBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie StatementDemocrats have argued that such a bill would lead to frivolous lawsuits and basically equate to censorship.\\n When asked for real\\nlife examples of schools or businesses telling students or employees that they are inherently racist because of the color of their skin, their Republican counterparts could come up with none.\\n “This bill\\'s not for Blacks, this bill was not for any other race,” said State Senator Shevrin Jones.\\n “This was directed to make whites not feel bad about what happened years ago.\\n At no point did anyone say white people should be held responsible for what happened, but what I would ask my white counterparts is, are you an enabler of what happened, or are you going to say we must talk about history?”\\n At a news conference last month, DeSantis, who has designs on the White House in 2024, called critical race theory “crap” and vowed to pass legislation allowing parents to sue schools and employees to sue employers if they are made to listen to such a thing.\\n Asked for comment by CBS News, the governor’s spokeswoman reiterated DeSantis’s embarrassing comments from the same news conference in which he suggested that Martin Luther King Jr. would be all for these Republican bills.\\n “You think about what MLK stood for.\\n He said he didn’t want people judged on the color of their skin but on the content of their character,” DeSantis said at the time.\\n “You listen to some of these people nowadays, they don’t talk about that.“\\n (Naturally, the governor, like other MLK\\nquoting Republicans, chose not to focus on the fact that King regularly reminded America of its racist roots and said things\\xa0like, “The Republican Party geared its appeal and program to racism, reaction, and extremism.\\n ”)Anyway, as MSNBC’s Ja’han Jones notes, this whole bill is about “prioritizing white hypersensitivity over truthful teachings” and saying “lessons about America’s racist and sexist past are acceptable only if they don’t offend white people.”\\n And, according to Jones, it’s nothing new!To me, these new demands for fealty to fragile whiteness sound like a re\\nup of the Black Codes, laws instituted during and after the Civil War to reinforce white supremacy.\\n In some states, the codes\\xa0permitted capital punishment against Black people for minor crimes like petty theft, allowed whippings for vagrancy and swearing, and banned Black land ownership.\\n Florida’s particularly harsh codes allowed white people to beat Black workers for “disrespect,” as historian Jerrell H. Shofner\\xa0wrote\\xa0in his 1976 essay on the state’s racist laws.\\n Historian Joe M. Richardson wrote that white Floridians passed the codes out of fear that their racist world was crumbling around them.\\xa0\\n It seems\\xa0DeSantis and Florida’s GOP\\nled legislature are operating with a similar fear.\\n They see the facade of white supremacy—weak as it is—crumbling under the weight of high school lesson plans and workplace trainings.\\n And bills like SB 148 are sad attempts to piece that facade back together....\\n That’s why—if the\\xa0white parents complaining about Black authors\\xa0weren’t enough—it’s clear that the Florida bill is designed to coddle white people, even though it doesn’t mention them specifically.\\xa0\\n Most PopularThe Idaho Murders, Part 1: How 4 College Kids Lived and LovedBy Kathleen HaleGrammys 2023 Red Carpet: All the Fashion, Outfits,

Anderson21st Century WireThe U.S. government, the ‘intelligence’ community and their malicious mainstream\\nmedia partners in deception just won’t let it go.\\n\\n The underhanded U.S. unitary state, which seeks a unipolar world with the U.S. in charge, still says in its “never ending story” that omniscient, omnipresent Russian leader Vladimir Putin masterminded hacking the computerized systems of U.S. elections as well as Democratic National Committee computers.\\n\\n But while that “bomb” allegedly influenced enough people to vote for the winner Donald Trump and not for loser Hillary Clinton, to this day, according to big media, we’re supposed to forget all about the creepy, damning, criminally inclined things contained in the Podesta\\nClinton emails themselves.\\n\\n So, let’s try and grasp this media\\nmassaged, intel\\ninfused message: Even though the emails apparently had enough sizzle and scandal to boost one presidential candidate over another, we’re still prodded to think that the information in the emails somehow isn’t the issue—even though the content\\xa0of the emails will always\\xa0be what matters the most.\\n\\n This is huge.\\n Think about it the next time you use an electronic “ES&S Ivotronic”\\xa0touchscreen voting machine or\\xa0Hart InterCivic’s model at the polls.\\n\\n All along, we’ve been reassured that the electronic voting systems used in about 95% of American voting precincts are The Greatest Thing Ever Invented and Monumentally Secure…\\nAre they really?THE ELECTORAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX: Securing America’s automated voting systems has become a complicated affair..\\n And, all along, writers like Yours Truly, highly credible Texas vote\\nreform activists like Laura Pressley, Vickie Karp, Bev Harris and others have uncovered tons of evidence that electronic elections are an immensely deceptive and vulnerable apparatus — vulnerable to external hacking and also to being “fixed” from the inside without any need for outside hacking, through the proprietary software inside the these voting contraptions that can be pre\\nset to steal elections if the need arises.\\n\\n You’re going to want to see my interview with Laura Pressley, on behalf of American Free Press, through this link right here.\\n Pressley shows in detail, the\\xa0integrity and lawfulness of Texas elections are in serious peril — not because of any outside “autocrats” like Putin and his supposed cyberspace minions, but because of state and local election officials, right here in the U.S., who absolutely will not follow state election law.\\n And the average TV or newspaper reporter is utterly tone\\ndeaf to these problems, which keeps the people in perpetual fog, unaware that U.S. elections have been effectively privatized by those who make the machines that count the votes.\\n\\n To hear more about this “Putin the Hacker” debacle, please listen to my Dec. 29, 2016 interview with UK\\nbased radio host Andrew Carrington Hitchcock on his regularly scheduled American Free Press (AFP) show.\\n\\n Furthermore, check out this Election Night Gatekeepers overview on my blog by election\\ntheft expert Jim Condit Jr., who worked with the late Collier brothers in their game\\nchanging book, “Votescam.”.\\n The media is part of a secretive consortium that counts the vote in secret, meaning the mainstream press’ fake news carries with it evidence of criminal collusion.\\n\\n The unavoidable conclusion is that the powers\\nthat\\nbe — in going after Putin and calling him The Supreme Hacker of the Known Universe\\xa0— have shot themselves in the foot because they’re clearly and finally admitting in the process that U.S. voting systems CAN be hacked, after more than a decade of denial.\\n\\n This means that all their denials about electronic election fraud are invalidated..\\n The critics of electronic election systems are right.\\n The establishment is wrong.\\n End of discussion.\\n\\n Meanwhile, recalling some recent history, Wayne Madsen Reports provided\\xa0some important perspective:“Although the Central Intelligence Agency has had a long history of undermining presidents\\nelect and prime ministers\\nelect in other countries, the United States has never witnessed the intelligence agency so blatantly attempting to politically weaken a U.S. president\\nelect\\n [Trump] just a few weeks prior to the inauguration.\\n What the CIA is doing in forcing Donald Trump into shifting from his campaign promise of restoring good relations with Russia to one of outright hostility to Moscow — favored by the CIA, Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the neo\\nconservatives within the Republican and Democratic Party establishments— is nothing less than an overt threat to American democracy.”WHERE\\n And, as American Free Press reported in its first 2017 edition, the young owner of a Russian\\nbased web\\nserver company may have a handle on who stole sensitive electronic communications between Hillary Clinton and some of her advisors.\\n\\n But 26\\nyear\\nold Vladimir Fomenko knows one thing for sure: U.S. intelligence, which professes to be hot on the trail of exposing Russian hacking, doesn’t seem to care about his story.\\n\\n This means that our leaders in Washington have long ignored a solid lead that could prove once and for all whether or not the Russian government hacked the computers systems of top Democrats and U.S. elections systems.\\n\\n Fomenko recently spoke to AFP to try and demystify the controversy surrounding his King Servers company and the cyberattacks purportedly carried out at the behest of Russia.\\n\\n AFP writer John Friend, quoting Fomenko, noted that even though his servers were exploited in this cyber\\ncrime: “No U.S. law enforcement or intelligence agency is interested in speaking with him to gather real evidence on the perpetrators.”\\nThe U.S. was not the only country hit by computer hackers.\\n Hackers evidently targeted Germany, Turkey, and Ukraine, apparently attempting to upset democratic processes.\\n\\n It was when WikiLeaks began releasing hacked data from the DNC late this past summer that media reports and the Clinton campaign began blaming Russia with no solid evidence to support that assertion.\\n\\n After learning about this shadowy criminal activity, Fomenko immediately shut down the servers and looked into the situation.\\n He says he’s willing to cooperate with law enforcement.\\n\\n “We pursued an investigation without delay and found some tracks leading to Europe,” Fomenko told AFP.\\n\\n “Web hosting is a legal enterprise.. . .\\n regulated by law,” Fomenko added.\\n “King Servers works in Russia, the U.S., and the Netherlands and complies with the laws of these countries.”\\nFomenko stressed: “No U.S. law enforcement agency has contacted us at this time.\\n Neither the FBI nor any other U.S., Russian, or Dutch intelligence agency has contacted us.\\n ”The plot thickens…\\xa0WSB\\nTV Channel 2 reporters in Atlanta, Georgia actually did their job and noted: “The Georgia Secretary of State’s office now confirms 10 different cyberattacks on its network all trace back to U.S. Department of Homeland Security IP addresses.”\\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, dissatisfied with the federal government’s dodgy explanation about these DHS cyberattacks, fired off a letter to then\\nPresident\\nelect Donald Trump to put him in the loop.\\n\\n So, it’ll be interesting to see if Trump ever helps Georgia, and other states whose election systems were supposedly hacked, figure out what happened and who’s really responsible.\\n\\n After all this time, the accusation that Russia “did it” still looks less and less credible, as this additional AFP piece outlines,\\xa0yet the American establishment, thinking it could blame Russia to explain Hillary’s loss and come to grips with Trump’s win, just won’t drop the blame\\nPutin narrative.\\n\\n We can only hope that Trump’s claim that he’ll start putting some limits on our out\\nof\\ncontrol spy agencies will come true.\\n If ever there was a good reason to pursue those limits, this high\\nlevel U.S. intelligence gambit to blame Putin, no matter what, is it.\\n The orthodox press has been a solid ally all along of these intel\\nintrigues.\\n\\n And this gives Trump a chance to prove he’s the real deal, and not another asset of the establishment, despite his seemingly honest intentions to name names and seek real solutions to the real problems that are troubling Americans and citizens across the world.\\n For, if elections are not really a means to find and assign better leaders who will use their victory as a mandate to do the right thing for the voters,\\xa0then what’s the point of having elections at all, hacked or not hacked, honest or not?Author Mark Anderson is an investigative journalist and features writer for American Free Press, and is editor of The

Steube is on the House floor denouncing the \"atrocities\" that have happened in the Capitol lately, namely ...\\n [squints at notes] ...\\n the installation of metal detectors pic.twitter.com\\nDnzPXRdh8B— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 13, 2021\\nAs Congress returns to its normal rhythms in the coming weeks, it may be that these heightened security measures are not necessary, and that more effective policy measures — or Capitol Police actually listening to FBI warnings of a “war” coming their way — will be more effective than a metal detector in keeping lawmakers safe.\\n In the interim, the outright rejection of efforts to secure the Capitol after it was overrun in a coordinated attack suggests that these lawmakers treat personal security about as seriously as they do pandemic safety.\\n Four of the five representatives seen in a video from Wednesday smugly refusing masks as they shelter in a crowded room — Marjorie Taylor Greene, Markwayne Mullin, Scott Perry, and Andy Biggs — objected to the presence of the metal detector.\\n\\n Sign Up for the Intelligencer\\xa0Newsletter\\nDaily news about the politics, business, and technology

between his national and early state poll numbers is a source of frustration for his campaign — and hope for his rivals..\\n Former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a rally in Concord, N.H., on Friday. \\n \\n Scott Eisen\\nGetty Images\\nBy Natasha Korecki and Marc Caputo\\n11\\n11\\n2019 05:04 AM EST\\nLink Copied\\nJoe Biden is the clear frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic race for president..\\n Or he’s faltering, slipping into fourth place as he loses ground to Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and an ascendant Pete Buttigieg..\\n Those alternate realities are playing out in real time — reflected in Biden’s solid standing atop national polls versus his middling performance in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys on the other.\\n The disparity is at once a source of frustration to Biden’s team and one of hope to rivals holding out for an utter collapse by the former vice president in the two earliest nominating states.\\n\\n The explanations for the discrepancy run the gamut.\\n The white Iowa and New Hampshire electorates play against Biden’s strength among ideological moderates and African Americans, some defenders argue.\\n Skeptics say it shows that the voters watching him most closely are underwhelmed..\\n There’s the fact that Biden pulled back on early state ad spending — both on TV and digitally — while competitors ramped up.\\n Finally, the Trump factor: The president’s reelection campaign has been running anti\\nBiden ads on TV in Iowa and more broadly over social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube..Nationally, the Real Clear Politics average shows Biden up by 7.7 percentage points; in at least half of recent polls, he’s leading by double digits.\\n In Iowa and New Hampshire, however, it’s Warren who’s up — by 4.3 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively..\\n Some Democratic analysts think the dual tracks are unsustainable — and that the reckoning won’t be pretty for Biden.\\n\\n “If Biden tanks in Iowa and New Hampshire, the national polls will follow,” said Patrick Murray, who directs the Monmouth University poll.\\n “The [national] numbers are ephemeral.\\n They’re not anchored like the early state polls, which determine who breaks out on the national scene.”\\n\\n But the states that immediately follow New Hampshire — South Carolina and Nevada— tell a different story.\\n Biden has consistently dominated in South Carolina and steadily leads in Nevada.\\n Biden advisers argue that’s because of more diverse electorates in those states: About 21 percent of Nevada’s caucusgoers are expected to be nonwhite, as are two\\nthirds of South Carolina’s primary voters.\\n\\n “Trump’s unprecedented attacks definitely don’t help, but Biden resonates with diverse populations,” said Amanda Loveday, the former director of the South Carolina Democratic Party who is now involved in a new pro\\nBiden super PAC.\\n “Out of the 10 states with the highest population of nonwhite residents, Biden is leading in seven of them.”\\n\\n Here’s a closer look at the factors driving Biden’s polling disparity, one of the key dynamics of the primary so far:\\nWhen Trump attacks\\nIn October, Trump started hitting Biden in early states with negative TV ads over his son Hunter’s work in Ukraine while the elder Biden was vice president.\\n To date, the Trump campaign has spent $287,000 on TV in Iowa alone, according to Advertising Analytics; it has spent far more on digital ads over Facebook and YouTube..How much of that went toward attacking Biden isn’t clear, but it appears to be significant.\\n Trump’s campaign and the Make America Great Again Committee — a joint fundraising committee of the campaign and Republican National Committee — have spent more than $25 million combined since January.\\n Digital ads targeting Biden on Ukraine have run on Facebook, YouTube and other platforms since October..“We have to confront the awful reality now that Trump’s illicit campaign to use Ukraine to bloody the leading Democratic candidate may be in fact working,” said Simon Rosenberg, founder of the New Democrat Network and a senior strategist for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018..\\n A new super PAC backing Biden released a memo over the weekendechoing that sentiment, saying Trump “wants to choose the nominee, and we aren’t willing to let that happen.”\\nVideo Player is loading.\\n Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time\\xa00:00\\nDuration\\xa00:00Loaded: 0%Stream\\n Type\\xa0LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining

nationally and in early states, allowing four of his primary challengers to outspend him on digital ads.\\n That includes Buttigieg, who spent $7.7 million — nearly twice as much as Biden — on digital ads from April to the first week of November.\\n The same is true on the airwaves: As Trump was attacking him in Iowa in October, Biden spent just $55,000 on TV ads there that month, compared to more than $1 million each for Sanders and Buttigieg..\\n At that same time, Buttigieg leapfrogged Biden in polls.\\n Biden supporters say recent Iowa poll numbers are not a sign of what’s to come but rather a reflection of a close race.\\n While recent polls show Biden in fourth place, they also show him and two others — Buttigieg and Sanders — within the margin of error for second place..John Anzalone, Biden’s chief pollster, disputes that Biden has dropped to fourth in Iowa; he thinks the former vice president is trailing only Warren in the state.\\n\\n “Historically, if you look at 2004, 2008 or 2016, the early states are always more competitive because that’s where all the paid communications are,” Anzalone said.\\n “Iowa is just naturally more competitive.\\n There has never been a time when Iowa hasn’t bunched up at this time.”\\n\\n Still, there’s no question Biden has lost ground in Iowa, steadily declining in local polling since the start of 2019..\\n Even the Steve Bullock campaign has had more activity in the last couple of weeks than Joe Biden,” Bagniewski said.\\n “What that tells me is he is pulling back a little bit in Iowa and concentrating on New Hampshire and South Carolina.\\n So it’s not surprising to me his numbers are dropping.”.\\n The Biden campaign, however, pointed to the fact that it has three campaign offices in Polk County, two of which opened after the Steak Fry, and that it has one of the most robust paid staffs in the state — more than 100 staffers — which will continue to grow until caucus day.\\n\\n DES MOINES, IOWA \\n NOVEMBER 01:

candidates hoping to win the Democratic nomination for president are expected to speak at the Celebration.\\n (Photo by Scott Olson\\nGetty Images)\\n\\n\\nScott Olson\\nGetty Images\\nCampaign aides say they also just launched a $4 million digital and TV ad buy in Iowa.\\n On top of that, the Biden super PAC, Unite the Country, aims to air TV ads in the next several weeks, and digital ads could come before that..\\n Patrick Bonsignore, director of digital advertising for the Biden campaign, said the campaign has consistently run ads on digital platforms including Hulu, ESPN, Pandora, Spotify, YouTube and Facebook.\\n The ads in early states, he said, delve into Biden’s biography and, the campaign is using viewership data to find ways of targeting new Biden voters and sustain their interest..“The best resource of our campaign is the vice president’s biography, the deep empathy for people and the way he’s fought for them and his vision for the future,” Bonsignore said.\\n Digital spending, the campaign said, will ramp up week to week until the Feb. 3 caucuses..\\n The theory of the case\\nBiden advisers argue no candidate has taken more flak in the media than the former vice president and yet he’s still stabilized his national numbers as scrutiny shifts to Warren and others in the field.\\n\\n In early September, Warren started breaking into the lead in some national polls.\\n She built enthusiasm and drew huge crowds at the same time Biden struggled in debates and with fundraising.\\n But Biden has since rebounded and even gained ground in a raft of recent national surveys..\\n Some analysts argue that national numbers can quickly shift based on the outcome in Iowa and New Hampshire.\\n In 2008, poll after poll showed Barack Obama trailing Hillary Clinton in South Carolina.\\n That changed once Obama proved his electability in Iowa..\\n “Obviously they are looking at it as a long\\ndistance race,” Peter Hart of Hart Research Associates said of Biden’s campaign.\\n “But everything is altered after the first two contests.”\\nStill, recent New York Times analyses show Democrats want a moderate nominee.\\n And in a head\\nto\\nhead analysis, surveys shows Biden beating Trump in nearly every battleground state, while Warren would lose to or, is even with, Trump in those places.\\n\\n “I think one of the things that isn’t covered in Democratic primaries, is the fact that this is actually a race for delegates,” Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz said on a recent donor call.\\n “Looking at a national poll and general election, you want to see where are the battleground numbers.\\n … By the time Super Tuesday is done, then we’re going to have a really good cross section of the Democratic Party in various regions.”.\\n Schultz again managed expectations on Iowa.\\n “I think because our coalition is so broad we’re the one campaign that does not have to win Iowa,” he said.\\n “We feel we can win Iowa, we’re playing to win.\\n Joe Biden is spending a lot of time there.\\n But our faith is in that broad coalition.”.\\n Filed under:.Polling,.Joe Biden,.\\n Joe Biden 2020,.\\n New Hampshire,.Iowa,.\\n Donald Trump,.\\n Donald

the Overtime segment, the former ‘Nightly Show’ host took it to the alt\\nright troll.\\n Marlow SternSenior Entertainment EditorUpdated\\xa0Apr. 11, 2017\\xa04:06PM ET\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Published\\xa0Feb. 18, 2017\\xa01:11AM ET\\xa0HBOBill Maher may have treated Milo Yiannopoulos with kid gloves, but Larry Wilmore was not here for the alt\\nright troll’s transphobic nonsense.\\n The former Daily Show correspondent and Nightly Show host, who now serves as the executive producer of ABC’s Black\\nish and co\\ncreator of HBO’s Insecure, was one of the panelists on Friday night’s edition of Real Time, and during the Overtime segment—that aired exclusively online—he squared off against Yiannopoulos.\\n After being asked by Maher why he singled out a transgender student for ridicule during a recent speech at University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Yiannopoulos intentionally referred to the former student as a “he” (she is a she), saying, “He had already left the university.\\n And I make no apologies for protecting women and children from men who are confused about their sexual identity.”\\n The Breitbart editor continued: “I did it on purpose.\\n I misgendered this person… I think women and girls should be protected from having men who are confused about their sexual identities from their bathrooms.”.\\n “That’s not unreasonable,” said Maher, who once again agreed with Yiannopoulos.\\n Then Wilmore stepped up to the plate.\\n “I just think it’s sad, because the same arguments that were used against gay people, treating them like aliens who wanted to fuck anything that moved and that’s why we should avoid them at all costs, are being used [against the trans community].”.\\n Yiannpoulos tried to interrupt, but was shot down by Wilmore: “Well, let me finish my thought, please.\\n No, It’s terrible.\\n It’s like when people try to compare gay and black.\\n Yeah, they’re not the same thing.\\n We shared invisibility.\\n People didn’t see us in society, and gay people hid out from society, but there were a lot of the same issues that you have to deal with when you’re marginalized.”.\\n “You can always find an extreme person that becomes the object of your attack to assign that to everybody,” he continued.\\n “So if you say, well that person is ‘weird’ or they want to commit sexual assault, then people think all transgender people want to do is commit sexual assault.\\n ”Then, as is his wont, Yiannopoulos shot back with, “Well, they are disproportionately involved in those kinds of crimes…\\n That’s not a controversial statistic, and frankly, you’re suggesting these people are the victims of some kind of discrimination, well I’m saying to you this is a psychiatric disorder—like identity disorder or like sociopathy.\\n ”Here, Yiannapoulos is correct: transgender people are “disproportionately involved” in sex crimes—as the victims.\\n According to the Office of Justice Programs, “One in two transgender individuals are sexually abused or assaulted at some point in their lives.\\n Some reports estimate that transgender survivors may experience rates of sexual assault up to 66 percent, often coupled with physical assaults or abuse.\\n This indicates that the majority of transgender individuals are living with the aftermath of trauma and the fear of possible repeat victimization.”So\\n Homosexuality was called a ‘disorder.’\\n It was [called] a ‘psychological disorder.’”.\\n “Maybe it is.\\n I feel really disordered,” replied Milo, trolling Wilmore.\\n “Maybe you are, but most homosexuals are not,” offered Wilmore..“No, I think most gays have a long road, actually, to coming to terms with their sexuality,” countered Yiannopoulos..“Yeah, because of the way society treats them!”\\n exclaimed Wilmore.\\n “If society said ‘we’re fine with gay people’ and it’s 1890, do you think in 1990 people are going to have an issue with it?”After being confronted by another panelist, former U.S. Navy officer and cryptology expert Malcolm Nance, Yiannapolous turned to Maher and quipped: “You always invite such awful people on your show!\\n They’re so stupid!”That really set Wilmore off.\\n “First of all, hold on, Bill: You can go fuck yourself,” Wilmore said to Yiannopoulos.\\n “If your argument is that these people are stupid, you didn’t hear a word this man\\n [Nance] said earlier in the segment, because he can talk circles around your pathetic, douchey little ass from England, alright?”Then, Wilmore addressed the comments Yiannopoulos made earlier in the night against SNL and Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones, whom he called “barely literate.”.\\n “And one last thing: Leslie Jones is not ‘barely literate.’\\n Go fuck yourself again for that one, OK?” said Wilmore, matter\\nof\\nfactly.\\n “She is a very thoughtful person, and very friendly.”.\\n\\n Trump and his allies are banned from these platforms \\n The Washington Post\\nAccessibility

Botsford for The Washington Post, AP, Getty and iStock (Washington Post illustration; Jabin Botsford for The Washington Post, AP, Getty and iStock)Comment on this storyCommentGift ArticleShareSome of the biggest names in tech have taken aggressive steps against the inflammatory rhetoric of President Trump and some of his allies that culminated last week with a mob of his supporters storming the U.S. Capitol while Congress was attempting to certify the election of Joe Biden as the nation’s 46th president.\\n Tech is not your friend.\\n We are.\\n Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.\\n ArrowRightThe moves are meant to guard against further efforts to incite violence and come after months of Trump’s relentless and unfounded allegations of voter fraud and his refusal to accept his loss in the 2020 election.\\n The platforms have been met with cries of censorship from Trump’s allies and reluctant applause from others who see the efforts as long overdue.\\n Here’s how the platforms cracked down on Trump and his supporters:.Twitter \\n.Facebook and Instagram \\n.YouTube \\n.Amazon Web Services \\n.Snapchat \\n.Reddit \\n.Twitch \\n.LiquidWeb \\n\\n .Shopify\\n\\n TwitterTwitter has been slapping labels on Trump’s posts that he won the 2020 election since November: “This claim about election fraud is disputed.”\\n The platform didn’t attempt to limit his 88 million followers from viewing or sharing such postings, as it had in June for Trump’s tweets labeling the people demonstrating as a result of the police killing of George Floyd as “THUGS.”Twitter purged more than 70,000 accounts affiliated with QAnon following Capitol riotFast\\nforward to Wednesday, Jan. 6: The platform locked Trump out of his account for 12 hours after the Capitol assault and said it wouldn’t return access until he deleted three tweets that violated its content policy.\\n Two days later, following two incendiary tweets from Trump, Twitter announced a permanent ban on his account.\\n The platform also later suspended @POTUS, the official account for the presidency, and his @TeamTrump campaign account after Trump attempted to try to skirt the ban.\\n After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.https:\\nt.co\\nCBpE1I6j8Y— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) January 8, 2021.Two Twitter accounts belonging to pro\\nTrump lawyer Lin Wood were permanently suspended Jan. 7 over tweets that the platform said incited violence.\\n One of the accounts, @FightBackLaw, was apparently being used to dodge the ban.\\n AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTwitter flagged a Saturday tweet by Rudolph W. Giuliani that linked to his appearance on the Stephen K. Bannon podcast “War Room,” and attached this label: “This claim of election fraud is disputed, and this Tweet can’t be replied to, retweeted or liked due to a risk of violence.”\\n Giuliani is Trump’s personal lawyer and one of the loudest proponents of the president’s debunked election fraud narrative, and he had falsely claimed on the podcast that the Capitol rioters were “trained anarchists” attempting to frame Trump.\\n Twitter said that the tweet violated its civic integrity policy.\\n Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, was subjected to a 12\\nhour ban until he removed a tweet in July, which included a video clip purporting the conspiratorial effects of the anti\\nmalaria drug hydroxychloroquine against the novel coronavirus.\\n Twitter said this violated its covid\\n19 misinformation policy.\\n His account remains active.\\n AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementLongtime\\n Trump ally Roger Stone was permanently banned in 2017 after mocking prominent journalists and media personalities, which Twitter said violated its abusive behavior rules.\\n On Jan. 8, two days after the Capitol riot, Twitter began purging conspiracy theory QAnon\\naffiliated accounts en masse, removing more than 70,000 by Tuesday, the company said in a blog post.\\n Twitter cited an increased risk of harm between online speech and real\\nworld events.\\n “We apply our rules impartially for all people on our service, regardless of background or political affiliation,” a Twitter spokeswoman said in an email.\\n “We’re constantly learning and improving in our efforts to serve the public conversation, and we’ll continue to be transparent with the public in this work.\\n ”Story continues below advertisementThe platform banned MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell on Jan. 26 for repeat violations of the company’s civic integrity policy, a Twitter spokeswoman said.\\n It was not immediately clear which tweets spurred the ban, but Lindell, a Republican donor, has amplified Trump’s claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election.\\n Gab, the social network that has welcomed Qanon and extremist figures, explainedFacebook and InstagramFacebook and its photo\\nsharing service, Instagram, suspended Trump for 24 hours starting Jan. 6 after he posted a video telling the mob that breached the Capitol to go home while also saying “we love you, you’re very special.”AdvertisementThe\\n next day, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced that Trump would be banned indefinitely though at least through the presidential transition.\\n Story continues below advertisement“The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden,” Zuckerberg wrote in a post.\\n “We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.”Parler\\n sues Amazon after pro\\nTrump site goes darkIn July, the platform removed more than 100 pages and accounts on Facebook and Instagram affiliated with Stone for using fake accounts to spread misinformation, the company said at the time.\\n Facebook and Instagram representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementYouTubeGoogle\\nowned YouTube suspended Trump’s channel for at least a week late Tuesday, announcing that it removed a video of his Tuesday morning news conference “in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence” that constituted his first strike.\\n The platform also indefinitely disabled comments from his channel.1\\n After review, and in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence, we removed new content uploaded to Donald J.

13, 2021.The move marked the strongest yet from the platform which, according to a thread tweeted by YouTube Insider, had said it would issue strikes to any channel posting videos with false claims — including about widespread voter fraud — that violate the platform’s policies.\\n The company said it has removed thousands of videos in the past month, including several posted by Trump, that “spread misinformation claiming widespread voter fraud changed the result of the 2020 election.”\\n Channels with one strike are temporarily suspended from posting or live\\nstreaming; three strikes within three months will warrant permanent removal.\\n Then, YouTube permanently banned Bannon’s channel “War Room” after he published videos that YouTube said violated its election misinformation policy, including the Giuliani appearance.\\n In an open letter released Thursday, the Alphabet Workers Union condemned the Capitol riot and said that YouTube and other social platforms have a responsibility to face the “growing fascist movement in the US.”\\n The group, which includes full\\ntime and temporary employees at Google and other Alphabet\\nowned companies in the U.S. and Canada, said it had warned YouTube executives about the danger of not removing content with hate, harassment and discrimination from the platform.\\n “We warned our executives about this danger, only to be ignored or given token concessions, and the results have been suicides, mass murders, violence around the world, and now an attempted coup at the Capitol of the United States,” the letter said.\\n “Once again, YouTube’s response yesterday was lackluster, demonstrating a continued policy of selective and insufficient enforcement of its guidelines against the use of the platform to spread hatred and extremism.”The\\n Google\\nowned site’s decision to cut President Trump off from the site follows decisions by other social media giants to restrict Trump on their platforms.\\n (Video: The Washington

Meanwhile, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has promised a number of gun control measures if elected\\xa0and has bragged about how he has “taken on” the NRA during his time as a senator.\\n \"We were proud to play a leading role in your 2016 election,\" the letter to Trump said.\\xa0\\n \"You promised to defend the Second Amendment and stand tall for the constitutional freedoms in which

22\\nyear\\nold’s detention.\\n \\n \\n AP Photo\\nBy Louis Nelson, Jake Lahut and Diamond Naga Siu\\n06\\n15\\n2017 07:07 AM EDT\\nUpdated:\\n06\\n15\\n2017 03:58 PM EDT\\nLink Copied\\nOtto Warmbier, the 22\\nyear\\nold American held prisoner by North Korea for 17 months, was released on “humanitarian grounds,” the nation’s state\\nrun news agency said Thursday.\\n\\n North Korea’s announcement came the same day Warmbier’s father held a news conference during which he criticized the Obama administration for not doing more to get his son released..\\n Warmbier had been sentenced to 15 years of labor for attempting to steal a propaganda poster during a January 2016 visit to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.\\n He was released this week and returned to the U.S. in a coma.\\n\\n “Under a decision by the DPRK Central Court of June 13, American citizen Otto Warmbier who was serving a sentence of labor was returned on June 13 on humanitarian grounds,” North Korea’s KCNA news agency said, using an acronym for the nation’s full name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in its brief report.\\n KCNA’s statement was first reported by Reuters.\\n Warmbier’s parents have denounced his detention, saying that he had been brutalized and terrorized by the secretive regime.\\n And former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said earlier this week that North Korea must explain what caused Warmbier to slip into a coma.\\n On Thursday, Warmbier’s father expressed both gratitude and frustration in an emotional news conference.\\n Fred Warmbier said he received a call from President Donald Trump on Wednesday night, and, when asked about his son’s current condition, said only that he and doctors were trying to make Otto “comfortable.”\\n Warmbier also critiqued the Obama administration when asked what more could have been done to obtain his son’s release before Trump took office.\\n “The question is, do I think the past administration could have done more?” he said.\\n “I think the results speak for themselves.”Speaking further to his frustrations before his son’s release, Warmbier lamented the fact that his family “relied on this false premise that [the North Koreans] would treat Otto fairly.”\\n He said publicity surrounding an interview with the family this week served as a catalyst for the release.\\n The interview, conducted Wednesday by Tucker Carlson, is scheduled to air Thursday night on Fox News.\\n Warmbier’s doctors provided an update on Thursday afternoon and said he is in a state of “unresponsive wakefulness.”\\n University of Cincinnati Health doctor Daniel Kanter said the most telling diagnostic was the magnetic resonance imaging brain scan.\\n\\n “This study showed extensive loss of brain tissue in all regions of the brain,” Kanter read from his prepared statement.\\n “This pattern of brain injury, however, is usually seen as a result of cardiopulmonary arrest where the blood supply to the brain is inadequate for a period of time, resulting in the death of brain tissue.”\\nBrandon Foreman, another doctor at University of Cincinnati Health, said they also conducted nerve toxin tests among the full\\nbody examination, since botulism is a toxin that causes nerve injury.\\n However, he said the tests did not detect any botulism, the sickness that North Korea said Warmbier allegedly contracted..Warmbier’s release came amid a period of high tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, which has launched multiple ballistic missile tests in an effort to build a nuclear weapon capable of striking the U.S.\\n Trump has sought to pressure China to, in turn, apply pressure on North Korea to halt its weapons program and scale back its bellicose rhetoric.\\n\\n Filed under:.Asia,.North Korea,.\\n Donald Trump,.\\n Donald Trump 2020,.\\n President Donald Trump\\nPOLITICO\\nLink Copied\\nAbout Us\\nAdvertising\\nBreaking News Alerts\\nCareers\\nCredit Card Payments\\nDigital Edition\\nFAQ\\nFeedback\\nHeadlines\\nPhotos\\nPOWERJobs\\nPress\\nPrint Subscriptions\\nRequest A Correction\\nWrite For Us\\nRSS\\nSite Map\\nTerms of Service\\nPrivacy Policy\\nDo not sell my info\\nNotice to California Residents.\\n\\n \\nDemocrats mull how much to build back, and when, in budget bill.\\n PoliticsCampaignsCongressWhite HousePolicyCoronavirusDefenseEnergyFintechHealth CareTechnologyTransportationAll PolicyHeard on the HillPodcastsCQ BudgetCQ on CongressCQ FutureEqual TimeFintech BeatPolicy BriefsPolitical TheaterOversightVideoMoreNewslettersCapitol InkRoll Call e\\nEditionOpinionEventsClassifiedsPoliticsCampaignsCongressWhite HousePolicyCoronavirusDefenseEnergyFintechHealth CareTechnologyTransportationAll\\n PolicyHeard on the HillPodcastsCQ BudgetCQ on CongressCQ FutureEqual TimeFintech BeatPolicy BriefsPolitical TheaterOversightVideoMoreNewslettersCapitol InkRoll Call e\\nEditionOpinionEventsClassifiedsSearch RollCall.comCongressDemocrats mull how much to build back, and when, in budget billManchin wants to start from scratch, while other Democrats want to begin with pieces he previously supportedSen. Edward J. Markey, D\\nMass., argues climate provisions Democrats largely reached consensus on during negotiations last year should serve as the basis for the latest iteration of the party\\'s budget package..\\n (Tom Williams\\nCQ Roll Call file photo)By Lindsey McPherson and Laura WeissPosted January 28, 2022 at 12:25pmDemocrats eager to enact some form of their climate and safety net package before the November midterm elections are floating disparate strategies for resurrecting negotiations West Virginia centrist Sen. Joe Manchin III squashed last month.\\n Manchin suggests “starting from scratch,” but his Democratic colleagues don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater.\\n Democrats have different views on how much of the House\\npassed $2.2 trillion package is salvageable and how long they should negotiate with Manchin after protracted talks last year led nowhere.\\n President Joe Biden said in a press conference last week he’s “confident” some pieces of the existing package will become law before the midterms, citing more than $500 billion in clean energy spending and tax incentives and funding for universal pre\\nkindergarten as examples of provisions that have broad support, including from Manchin.\\n But Biden said he’s “not sure” a renewal of the expired child tax credit expansion providing monthly checks to families of up to $300 per child will remain in the next iteration given Manchin’s opposition to the current structure.\\n “I think we can break the package up, get as much as we can now, and come back and fight for the rest later,” he said.\\n Most Democrats agree with Biden’s general strategy, but there are different factions forming around what’s actually doable now when it comes to the sweeping budget bill they\\'ve dubbed \"Build Back Better.\"Sen.\\n Edward J. Markey, D\\nMass., said in a statement last week that Democrats should start with the climate and clean energy provisions because those “have been largely worked through and financed” to win Manchin’s approval.\\n Other Democrats agree the climate provisions should serve as the basis of the package and any others that can get 50 votes can be added in.\\n Since saying he wanted to start negotiations from scratch, the climate provisions are the only piece of the package Manchin has reiterated he could support.\\n “I think that there’s a lot of areas in climate that we agree,” he said in an interview with Newsy on Wednesday.\\n Child credit coalitionAnother group of senators still wants to build the package around the expanded child tax credit, despite Manchin\\'s argument that the benefit should be further restricted based on income and work requirements.\\n \"West\\n Virginians basically that make $75,000 or less should be the highest priority we have,\" Manchin said Thursday on Talkline with Hoppy Kercheval, a local radio show.\\n The current maximum child credit extends to individuals earning up to $200,000 and households making up to $400,000, though the lapsed credit expansion phased out at $75,000 and $150,000, respectively.\\n Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Ron Wyden of Oregon sent a letter Wednesday to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris requesting it be “a centerpiece of the legislation.\\n ”“The expanded CTC is a signature domestic policy achievement of this administration, and has been an overwhelming success,” the senators wrote, warning of “dire” consequences for failing to extend it.\\n “Without the expanded credit, nearly 10 million children will be thrown back into or deeper into poverty this winter.\\n ”While\\n many Democrats wax optimistic about striking a deal with Manchin on the child tax credit, others acknowledge it may not be feasible, especially with the party looking to pass something soon before election year politics further complicate negotiations.\\n “We think that the child tax credit is very, very important.\\n It doesn’t have 51 votes though,” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer said Tuesday in a Politico Playbook interview.\\n “We have to look at what we can get, not what we’d like to get.”Although\\n there’s no deadline for advancing a revised package, Hoyer urged the Senate to move quickly.\\n “The component parts that I think there is consensus on, let’s pass those, let’s get them done,” the Maryland Democrat said.\\n The economic package is far from the only thing on Congress\\' short\\nterm to\\ndo list.\\n Lawmakers are trying to negotiate an omnibus appropriations deal before stopgap funding expires Feb. 18; reach agreement on legislation designed to resolve supply chain issues and boost U.S. competitiveness with China; pass sanctions to deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine; and advance a Supreme Court nomination through the Senate.\\'Act without dragging\\'In a Monday Twitter thread, Sen. Tina Smith, D\\nMinn., acknowledged her colleagues’ frustration but urged them to listen to what Manchin has said and “act without dragging this out.\\n ”“I’ve been in [sic] involved in complicated negotiations for a long time, and one thing I’ve learned is you have to know when to take no for an answer.\\n And also when to hear yes and take it,” she said.\\n “Time to focus on what\\'s possible and deliver.”.I\\'ve been in a lot of negotiations, with lots of frustration.\\n Build Back Better is no exception..\\n Here are my thoughts.\\n [Thread]— Senator Tina Smith (@SenTinaSmith) January 24, 2022.Congressional Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal acknowledged in a CNN interview last week that the House tried to push Manchin too far by adding things to the package he did not support, like paid leave.\\n “We gave him the pen.\\n And we said, ‘OK, you write it.’”Manchin\\n never endorsed the framework, and he criticized parts of it, like the one\\nyear extension of the child tax credit and funding for Medicare to cover hearing benefits.\\n Several Democrats say Manchin needs to be more clear about what he supports, not just what he opposes, before negotiations can advance.\\n Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders, I\\nVt., has called on Democrats to end backroom negotiations and bring the debate to the Senate floor.\\n He reasons that voting on the package and individual elements of it will show the American people Republicans are obstructing popular policy changes, as well as clarify which aspects Manchin will support.\\n \\'SALT\\' sagaAppeasing Manchin is the primary obstacle to a deal, but there are other intraparty disputes Democrats have to navigate to ensure a revised package can get to Biden’s desk.\\n Chief among them is whether to provide some relief from a Republican\\nenacted $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction.\\n It’s a top priority for Democrats from high\\ntax states like New Jersey, New York and California, but progressives from lower tax states are reluctant to provide a tax break that disproportionately benefits the wealthy.\\n Sen. Bob Menendez, D\\nN.J., and Sanders sought to negotiate a compromise that could pass the Senate but those talks paused as the package stalled.\\n Their cooperation appeared to end Wednesday after The Hill reported that no relief would make it into the squeezed bill.\\n Sanders hailed the report on Twitter.\\n Menendez hit back in his own tweet, implying Sanders had reversed himself from comments he made in the fall calling the cap “a regressive and unfair proposal.\\n And this Congress must rectify it.”Menendez\\n also said in a statement that “SALT remains high in my list of priorities.”\\n While he didn’t say whether a final version must address the SALT cap to get his vote, a trio of House Democrats have.\\n “If there are any efforts that include a change in the tax code, then a SALT fix must be part of it,” New York Rep. Tom Suozzi and New Jersey Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill said in a joint statement last week.\\n “No SALT, no deal.\\n that needle is difficult since Democrats have zero votes to spare in the Senate and only four in the House amid universal GOP opposition.\\n Only one Democrat, Maine’s Jared Golden, voted against the House package, but his primary complaint was the SALT cap increase, so he could switch positions if it’s left untouched.\\n There are other pockets of lawmakers whose support for a slimmer package is not guaranteed.\\n That includes a trio of House Democrats who said they would oppose any package that did not provide legal protections for millions of undocumented immigrations, three versions of which the Senate parliamentarian rejected as violating the budget reconciliation rules.\\n The six\\nmember progressive “squad” that voted against the bipartisan infrastructure bill because they wanted to hold it as leverage for Manchin to support a bigger reconciliation package may be reluctant to accept further cuts.\\n Hoyer predicts enough of those members will ultimately support whatever can get through the Senate.\\n “It’s the art of the possible.\\n Legislating is not perfect,” he said.\\n “You can’t make the perfect the enemy of the good \\n a hackneyed statement but an absolute true one.”The\\n Source for news on Capitol Hill since 1955AboutContact

did.”\\nBYPASS THE CENSORS\\nSign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox.\\n\\n Email*.NameThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\\n\\n By subscribing you agree to our Terms of Use.Thegatewaypundit.com reports: Butowsky further stated that the family was deeply concerned with their son being remembered for helping to get President Donald Trump elected.\\n\\n Speaking to Butowsky by phone on Thursday evening, he told the Gateway Pundit that during a conversation with Joel Rich on December 17, 2016 at 3:17 p.m., the father stated “we know what our sons did, but we just want to find Seth’s killer.”\\n\\n In an audio recording that I previously obtained, private investigator Rod Wheeler explained that Seth’s brother, Aaron Rich, had tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth’s computer — even though there could be evidence on it.\\n\\n Wheeler said that Seth’s girlfriend told him that Aaron Rich had possession of Seth’s cell phones, but Aaron denied it and said “we’re not going to worry about the cell phones.”\\nAaron also blocked Wheeler from finding out about who was at a party Seth attended the night of the murder.\\n\\n “All I want you to do is work on the botched robbery theory and that’s it,” Aaron told Wheeler, according to Wheeler’s claim on the audio.\\n Wheeler said that Seth’s father Joel “does not appear to have any hidden agenda.”\\n\\n “He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,” Wheeler said.\\n “I said, well can I look at it?…He said, what are you looking for?\\n I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone.\\n He said no, I already checked it.\\n Don’t worry about it.”\\nAaron Rich works for\\xa0Northrup Grumman, which was named as the fifth\\nlargest defense contractor in the world in 2015, as a lead software developer.\\n\\n “It’s not just hacking and defending, there’s a lot more to it,” a cyber software engineer at Northrup Grumman says in a video on the company’s website.\\n\\n An additional leaked phone conversation I previously obtained featured award winning journalist Sy Hersh confirming that Rich had made contact with WikiLeaks.\\n\\n “There are no DNC or Podesta emails that exist beyond May 21 or 22, last email from either one of those groups.\\n What the report says is that some time in late Spring… he makes contact with WikiLeaks, that’s in his computer,” he says.\\n “Anyway, they found what he had done is that he had submitted a series of documents — of emails, of juicy emails, from the DNC.”\\n\\n “All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I’m sure dozens of emails, and said ‘I want money.’\\n Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,” he said.\\n They got access to the DropBox.”\\nHersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him, and had shared the DropBox with trusted associates incase anything happened to him.\\n\\n “The word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that ‘if anything happens to me it’s not going to solve your problems,’” he added.\\n “WikiLeaks got access before he was killed.”.\\n Audio tape of Seymour Hersh discussing WikiLeaks DNC leaks and Seth Rich https:\\nt.co\\nSTp9u7Vtbn h\\nt @CassandraRules\\n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) August 1, 2017.In an email exchange that had been previously provided to me exclusively, Butowsky pleaded with Hersh to go to Congress with what he knew.\\n\\n “I am curious why you haven’t approached the house committee telling them what you were read by your FBI friend related to Seth Rich that you in turn read to me.\\n Based on all your work, it appears that you care about the truth.\\n Even though, as you said you couldn’t get a second, shouldn’t you tell them so they could use their powers to determine the truth?”\\n Butowsky asked.\\n\\n In a bizarre response completely contradicting what Hersh is heard saying on the audio recording, he denies having any inside knowledge of the case.\\n\\n “ed –you have a lousy memory…i was not read anything by my fbi friend..\\n i have no firsthand information and i really wish you would stop telling others information that you think i have…please stop relaying information that you do not have right…and that i.have no reason to believe is accurate…” Hersh wrote.\\n\\n Desperate to find the truth about what happened, Bukowsky continues to plead with the journalist to go forward.\\n\\n “I know it isn’t first hand knowledge but you clearly said, my memory is perfect, that you had a friend at the FBI who read \\n told you what was in the file on Seth Rich and I wonder why you aren’t helping your country and sharing that information on who it was?”\\n Interestingly, a new report published on Thursday evening by the Washington Times also confirms that Rich had downloaded thousands of DNC emails.\\n\\n “Another aspect that needs to be uncovered is the FBI’s ‘denial’ that its cyber experts who share space with the D.C. Metro police department at Cleveland Avenue in the District, assisted in accessing data on Mr. Rich’s laptop.\\n Not likely.\\n Data on the laptop revealed that Mr. Rich downloaded thousands of DNC emails and was in touch with Wikileaks.\\n The file with evidence of what was on Mr. Rich’s laptop sits with the FBI in a co\\nshared space with the D.C. police department.\\n According to Ed Butowsky, an acquaintance of the family, in his discussions with Joel and Mary Rich, they confirmed that their son transmitted the DNC emails to Wikileaks,” the Washinton Times reported.\\n\\n\\n It\\n39Comments\\n39.Leave a Comment\\nSearch\\nSearch\\nClose.\\n Things you buy through our links may earn New York a commission.\\ncapitol riot.\\n Jan. 12, 2021\\nHouse Republicans Disobey Police, Dodge Metal Detectors in Capitol\\nBy.\\n Matt Stieb,.\\n Intelligencer staff writer.\\n Rage against the machine..\\n Photo: AFP via Getty Images\\nAs a response to the attack on the Capitol Building, which resulted in five dead and at least three representatives with positive COVID cases, House leadership instituted some new rules, including mandatory face coverings and a metal detector outside the chamber doors.\\n Most lawmakers agreed to the basic security measure even if it obstructed the usual flow of the U.S. Congress at work.\\n\\n But several Republican legislators objected to the metal detectors.\\n “This is bullshit,” Illinois representative Rodney Davis told a Capitol Police officer manning the machine.\\n Arkansas representative Steve Womack reportedly expanded on the idea to an officer who did not have a say in the policy: “You are creating a problem you do not understand the ramifications of.”\\n As the night progressed, many more ignored the cops who had scores of colleagues injured by Trump supporters six days ago:.Louie\\n Gohmert just walked around the magnetometer.\\n “You can’t stop me; I’m on my way to a vote,” he said as he passed the cops.— Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) January 13, 2021\\nAnother member — I believe it was Russ Fulcher —.just pushed his way through.\\n He went through the metal detector, set it off, ran into a cop, and then pushed his way past her.— Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) January 13, 2021\\n\\n Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, who has bragged about her desire to carry a weapon on Capital Hill is currently in a standoff with Capitol Police at the newly installed Metal Detectors outside the chamber doors.\\n — Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) January 13, 2021\\nJust watched about 10 Republicans walk around the magnetometer.\\n Didn’t\\n see them all, but among the group was Ralph Northham and Scott Perry.\\n Jeff Duncan bypassed the metal detector right before them.—\\n Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) January 13, 2021\\nThere appear to be a few party lines forming among the Republicans who oppose the magnetometer.\\n For Oklahoma representative Markwayne Mullin, it is his “constitutional right” to not go through a device that did not exist when the Constitution was written.\\n Six days after a stunt vote she supported helped lead to the Capitol riot, Lauren Boebert said the heightened security is a “political stunt by Speaker Pelosi.”\\n “We now live in Pelosi’s communist America!”\\n tweeted Arizona representative Debbie Lesko, of a policy that many American high\\nschoolers have been subject to for decades.\\n (Like in some of our nation’s high schools, the GOP’s refusal to stop representatives who want to bring guns inside the Capitol suggests the “good guys with guns” philosophy wins out in both settings.)\\n\\n The most practical objection came from Louisiana representative Steve Scalise, who told CNN that the situation is “untenable” because it “impedes the ability of members to come and vote.”\\n Scalise — who was shot in a left\\nwing extremist attack in 2017 — did not mention that Democratic representatives and the majority of Republicans complied with the measure.\\n The most tone\\ndeaf objection came from Florida representative Greg Steube:.Republican Rep. Steube is on the House floor denouncing the \"atrocities\" that have happened in the Capitol lately, namely ...\\n [squints at notes] ...\\n the installation of metal detectors pic.twitter.com\\nDnzPXRdh8B— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 13, 2021\\nAs Congress returns to its normal rhythms in the coming weeks, it may be that these heightened security measures are not necessary, and that more effective policy measures — or Capitol Police actually listening to FBI warnings of a “war” coming their way — will be more effective than a metal detector in keeping lawmakers safe.\\n In the interim, the outright rejection of efforts to secure the Capitol after it was overrun in a coordinated attack suggests that these lawmakers treat personal security about as seriously as they do pandemic safety.\\n Four of the five representatives seen in a video from Wednesday smugly refusing masks as they shelter in a crowded room — Marjorie Taylor Greene, Markwayne

2021\\nHouse Republicans Disobey Police, Dodge Metal Detectors in Capitol\\nBy.\\n Matt Stieb,.\\n Intelligencer staff writer.\\n Rage against the machine..\\n Photo: AFP via Getty Images\\nAs a response to the attack on the Capitol Building, which resulted in five dead and at least three representatives with positive COVID cases, House leadership instituted some new rules, including mandatory face coverings and a metal detector outside the chamber doors.\\n Most lawmakers agreed to the basic security measure even if it obstructed the usual flow of the U.S. Congress at work.\\n\\n But several Republican legislators objected to the metal detectors.\\n “This is bullshit,” Illinois representative Rodney Davis told a Capitol Police officer manning the machine.\\n Arkansas representative Steve Womack reportedly expanded on the idea to an officer who did not have a say in the policy: “You are creating a problem you do not understand the ramifications of.”\\n As the night progressed, many more ignored the cops who had scores of colleagues injured by Trump supporters six days ago:.Louie\\n “You can’t stop me; I’m on my way to a vote,” he said as he passed the cops.— Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) January 13, 2021\\nAnother member — I believe it was Russ Fulcher —.just pushed his way through.\\n He went through the metal detector, set it off, ran into a cop, and then pushed his way past her.— Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) January 13, 2021\\n\\n Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, who has bragged about her desire to carry a weapon on Capital Hill is currently in a standoff with Capitol Police at the newly installed Metal Detectors outside the chamber doors.\\n — Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) January 13, 2021\\nJust watched about 10 Republicans walk around the magnetometer.\\n Didn’t\\n see them all, but among the group was Ralph Northham and Scott Perry.\\n Jeff Duncan bypassed the metal detector right before them.—\\n Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) January 13, 2021\\nThere appear to be a few party lines forming among the Republicans who oppose the magnetometer.\\n For Oklahoma representative Markwayne Mullin, it is his “constitutional right” to not go through a device that did not exist when the Constitution was written.\\n Six days after a stunt vote she supported helped lead to the Capitol riot, Lauren Boebert said the heightened security is a “political stunt by Speaker Pelosi.”\\n “We now live in Pelosi’s communist America!”\\n tweeted Arizona representative Debbie Lesko, of a policy that many American high\\nschoolers have been subject to for decades.\\n (Like in some of our nation’s high schools, the GOP’s refusal to stop representatives who want to bring guns inside the Capitol suggests the “good guys with guns” philosophy wins out in both settings.)\\n\\n The most practical objection came from Louisiana representative Steve Scalise, who told CNN that the situation is “untenable” because it “impedes the ability of members to come and vote.”\\n Scalise — who was shot in a left\\nwing extremist attack in 2017 — did not mention that Democratic representatives and the majority of Republicans complied with the measure.\\n The most tone\\ndeaf objection came from Florida representative Greg Steube:.Republican Rep. Steube is on the House floor denouncing the \"atrocities\" that have happened in the Capitol lately, namely ...\\n [squints at notes] ...\\n the installation of metal detectors pic.twitter.com\\nDnzPXRdh8B— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 13, 2021\\nAs Congress returns to its normal rhythms in the coming weeks, it may be that these heightened security measures are not necessary, and that more effective policy measures — or Capitol Police actually listening to FBI warnings of a “war” coming their way — will be more effective than a metal detector in keeping lawmakers safe.\\n In the interim, the outright rejection of efforts to secure the Capitol after it was overrun in a coordinated attack suggests that these lawmakers treat personal security about as seriously as they do pandemic safety.\\n Four of the five representatives seen in a video from Wednesday smugly refusing masks as they shelter in a crowded room — Marjorie Taylor Greene, Markwayne Mullin, Scott Perry, and Andy Biggs — objected to the presence of the metal detector.\\n\\n Sign Up for the Intelligencer\\xa0Newsletter\\nDaily news about the politics, business, and technology

several more contenders for top U.S. posts including Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani, as blunt\\nspoken retired Marine Corps General James Mattis emerged as a leading candidate for defense secretary.\\n Trump held meetings at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, with candidates for senior administration jobs after he takes office on Jan. 20.\\n On Saturday, he conferred with Mattis and Mitt Romney, formerly a fierce Trump critic now under consideration for secretary of state.\\n Summing up two days of talks as he said goodbye to retired U.S. Marines Corps General John Kelly on Sunday evening, Trump said he had made decisions on a couple of appointments.\\n \"We really had some great meetings, and you’ll be hearing about them soon.”\\n Trump transition spokesman Sean Spicer said no decisions would be announced on Sunday night.\\n Trump discussed the treasury secretary job with Jon Gray, a board member of the Blackstone Group, two sources familiar with their meeting said.\\n A Trump transition team statement said their discussion included the U.S. economy, global capital markets and the world financial situation, as well as tax reform and long\\nterm debt.\\n The last person Trump escorted out of the clubhouse was Giuliani, the former New York mayor.\\n Trump said earlier that Giuliani was a candidate for secretary of state \"and other things.\"\\n The Trump team statement said Trump and Giuliani discussed \"administration priorities\" as well as \"restoring America’s prominence in the world, ongoing national security issues and threats at various hotspots on a global basis.\"\\n Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, advised Trump during the presidential campaign but was dismissed as the head of his transition team.\\n Asked by reporters before the meeting whether there was a place for Christie in his administration, Trump sidestepped the question but called him \"a very talented man, great guy.\"\\n Trump met with billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, who he said was under consideration for commerce secretary.\\n Asked whether he wanted the job, Ross told reporters: \"Well, time will tell.\"\\n Trump also received Jonathan Gray, the global head of real estate at the Blackstone Group, who is being considered for Treasury secretary, according to a person briefed on the matter.\\n The president\\nelect has already tapped three senior leaders of his national security and law enforcement teams, choosing U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general, U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo as CIA director, and retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as national security adviser.\\n OBAMA TO DEFEND \\'CORE VALUES\\' The selections so far suggest that Trump, true to his campaign promises, intends to steer national security and foreign policy in a sharply different direction from that of Democratic President Barack Obama, whose record Trump harshly criticized during his campaign.\\n Obama campaigned extensively for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton before the Nov. 8 election and warned during the campaign that Trump lacked the temperament and qualifications to be president.\\n In Peru, as he wrapped up his last foreign trip, one that was overshadowed by Trump\\'s surprise election, Obama encouraged Democrats on Sunday to work with the new administration but said he would weigh in as a citizen if the Trump administration challenged values he holds dear.\\n In another sign of Trump\\'s novel approach to politics, the New York businessman who has never held public office said he planned to live in the White House but that his wife, Melania, and their 10\\nyear\\nold son, Barron, would not move in immediately.\\n He said they would move from New York to the White House \"very soon, right after he finishes school.\"\\n While Trump received lawmakers, politicians and business leaders behind closed doors over the weekend, he gave some hints about his thinking and possible Cabinet choices on Twitter.\\n On Sunday, he tweeted that \"General James \\'Mad Dog\\' Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday.\\n\\n Why\\'d he believe his lie?IE 11 is not supported.\\n For an optimal experience visit our site on another browser.\\n TO CONTENTNewsNBC News NOWNightly NewsMeet the

stung by them as a result.\\n RelatedOpinionOpinionWhat liberals never understood about Rush Limbaugh\\'s appealAfter all, people who have made a living out of spreading outrageous lies are generally not stupid.\\n They are experts at self\\ndeception.\\n I know from writing a book about honesty — which was published just a month before Covid\\n19 exploded — that self\\ndeception is the strongest and most mysterious of all the deceptions.\\n With self\\ndeception, you’re both the teller and receiver of the lie.\\n That duality can strengthen and turn toxic the biases most of us work to keep in check.\\n One of those biases is simple overconfidence.\\n We are, it turns out, stunningly overconfident, especially when it comes to our intelligence.\\n For example, Yale University’s Zoe Chance has found that if you let people “accidentally” cheat on a difficult test by giving them an answer key, they will attribute their good performance to their intelligence.\\n In her study, the answer\\nkey group predicted they would do well on the next test even once they saw there was no answer key.\\n (They didn’t.)Rush Limbaugh, conservative radio host, dies at age 70Feb.\\n 17, 202103:01When people believe something about themselves, they don’t want to give it up, even in the face of evidence against their belief.\\n One of the key aspects behind this phenomenon is our use of “motivated reasoning.”\\n The definition of motivated reasoning I like best is writer Tim Harford’s, from a fascinating piece detailing how the world’s top authority on Dutch painters managed to convince himself a forged Johannes Vermeer painting was the real thing when it so obviously wasn’t.\\n “Motivated reasoning is thinking through a topic with the aim of reaching a particular conclusion,” Harford explains.\\n You know what you want to be true, so you let the outcome you desire guide your thinking.\\n If you’re certain that you’re smarter than most other people and you tune out all evidence that contradicts that, why wouldn’t you believe yourself?\\n This explains how blind spots become entrenched in one’s thinking.\\n But what motivates people to be deceptive to begin

R. McMaster, just finished up a presser on the outrage du jour, the Washington Post story that Donald Trump inappropriately shared highly classified information with Russian Prime Minster Sergey Lavrov.\\n\\n Personally, I like McMaster and thought he did as well as could be done considering no one in the briefing was predisposed to do anything but scream RUSSIA!!!\\n But I realize I’m going to be in a minority position on RedState in that belief.\\n\\n These are the highlights.\\n\\n [&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=”\\nstorify.com\\nstreiff\\nmcmaster\\npresser”

statement of yesterday which is that the story is false.\\n Unlike some of my colleagues and most of Twitter, I don’t see the ambiguity of his denial.\\n He said, “The story that came out tonight as reported is false.”\\n I don’t know how you can get any clearer than that, it isn’t a denial of details or hedging it is a denial of the story.\\n If the story “as reported” is false then the Washington Post story is false.\\n\\n The point about leaks being the issue is a critical one, but I’ll hit that in a second.\\n\\n McMaster said what was shared was appropriate.\\n He also says it was nothing that couldn’t be found in open source reporting.\\n\\n There have been some comments to the effect that McMaster “didn’t deny” which city the information came from.\\n In fact, he said quite clearly that all the information was available via open source reporting and, therefore, any city Trump might have mentioned has already been mentioned in an unclassified environment.\\n\\n The statement that is getting the most attention is this:.McMaster: \"The president wasn\\'t even aware of where the information came from.\\n He wasn\\'t even briefed on the sources and methods.\\n \"\\n— Eli Stokols (@EliStokols) May 16, 2017.This is being portrayed as Trump being stupid or something.\\n All it means is that the information Trump had on the subject did not identify sources or methods and, as McMaster said, was available from open source reporting.\\n When I was doing a stint in Army War Plans division, we tried to sanitize information as much as possible.\\n If a quote from TIME or Newsweek was accurate we’d include it in intel summaries rather than codeword information just to make it easier to deal with the security requirements.\\n\\n In that story, Erick speaks of aids feeling like Trump doesn’t listen to them but he does listen to the press, so they leak these stories to embarrass Trump publicly in order, they hope, to make him change his ways.\\n This is unprofessional, dangerous, sad, and pathetic.\\n\\n In this case, suppose McMaster is telling the truth–and when the day comes that you take the word of unnamed sources over McMaster we’ve really nothing else to talk about–and Trump did share with the Russians information that was available from open source reporting.\\n And that Trump had been briefed on the information in a sanitized form with sources and methods omitted.\\n Now, thanks to the leak, the Russians know that information was not open source but that we have a highly placed source inside ISIS being run by an allied intelligence service.\\n If you think for a second there is an allied intelligence service in the fight against ISIS that isn’t working hand in glove with the Russians, think again.\\n Over the past eight years, the foreign policy choices made by the Obama administration increased the profile of Russia in the Middle East.\\n If the story were true, what the leakers did was indistinguishable from what Trump did with the exception being that the leakers knew they were telling the Russians they’d heard classified information.\\n More to the point, this changes nothing.\\n RedState member since

restaurant..Bethania Palma.\\n Advertisment:\\nClaim:.Police raided an Olive Garden and made a \"disturbing find\" thanks to Obama\\'s Muslim refugees..Rating:.False.\\n About this rating.\\n In early May 2017, far\\nright blog FreedomDaily.com posted a story with a misleading headline reporting that Rochester, Minnesota police had raided an Olive Garden restaurant \"where Obama’s Muslim refugees were\", only to make a\"DISTURBING find inside\":\\nThe Olive Garden is arguably one of America’s most beloved restaurant chains for their delicious dishes and comfortable family environment.\\n However, when Barack Obama’s Muslim refugees take over one of these eateries, it becomes the last place you ever want to be caught dining, and probably make you hate pasta for the rest of your life.\\n This is especially the case at one popular location that became customers’ worst nightmare after cops raided it and made a disturbing find inside.\\n ...\\n\\n Although there were three Muslim men who participated in the brutal lunch hour exchange of gunfire, one two have been caught and charged.\\n The third got away with it and is likely being harbored by fellow refugees until the urge to kill strikes again — which is only a matter of time.\\n\\n Rochester police Capt. John Sherwin told us by phone that authorities never raided an Olive Garden restaurant.\\n Instead, they arrested two men, Abdi Omar Abukar, 21, and Idris Abdillahi Haji\\nMohamed, 22, who are suspected of shooting at a third person while running through a parking lot shared by\\xa0an Olive Garden in Rochester..\\n Police believe the chase started at a nearby apartment complex.\\n Sherwin said the immigration status of the men is not known and police do not have enough information on the third person to have a description of his ethnic background, telling us:\\xa0Advertisement:\\nThat article is fake.\\n That information is not coming from local law enforcement or any information that has been given out regarding this case.\\n There are assumptions being made about many things based on names [of the suspects].\\n We did not raid the Olive Garden —\\xa0however, it is lunch time and I’m thinking about getting some bread sticks now.\\n\\n Sherwin referred us to an article in the local newspaper, the Post\\nBulletin, for an accurate representation of the incident.\\n According to the paper, the shooting took place on 2 May 2017, and\\xa0Akubar had a previous criminal history:\\nAbukar pleaded guilty April 3 in Olmsted County District Court to one of two identical felony counts of third\\ndegree drug sale.\\n He had posted $40,000 conditional bail in March, which was allowed to remain in place after his guilty plea.\\n He\\'s scheduled to be sentenced in the case May 24.\\n\\n Less than two weeks after that plea, local law enforcement developed information that Abukar again was selling crack cocaine, court documents show.\\n An undercover drug buy confirmed the crime, the document says, and a warrant for his arrest was issued April 26.\\n\\n Abukar turned himself in Monday and that day appeared before visiting judge Dennis J. Murphy on one count each of second\\ndegree drug sale and third\\ndegree drug possession, both felonies.\\n Murphy set conditional bail at $20,000, which Abukar posted immediately.\\n\\n The next day, authorities received multiple 911 calls about 12:50 p.m., reporting shots fired in a parking lot at Minnwest Bank,\\n Several witnesses gave similar stories, describing two men chasing another man, firing guns as they ran.\\n\\n No information regarding the nation of origin of the two suspects has been released to the public, but local news media reports say both men are originally from Rochester.\\n Authorities have little information on the person who the two are suspected of chasing and firing on, and do not believe that person is being \"harbored by fellow refugees\".\\n Further, police did not \"raid\" an Olive Garden restaurant, nor did the incident occur at Olive Garden; the three men were simply seen running through a shared commercial parking lot.\\n Sherwin told us that because Rochester has a large Somali population, it\\'s not the first time the community has been the subject of a fake news item that appears to deliberately stir\\xa0up fear about immigrants.\\n The FreedomDaily.com article appears to have manipulated a local crime story to fit an anti\\nimmigrant and anti\\nMuslim narrative.\\n\\n Shea, Amanda.\\n\\n Lindsey Graham, One of Trump\\'s Greatest

Published Oct 30, 2019\\n7th July 1964:.British drummer Ringo Starr of The Beatles in London on his 24th birthday..\\n Powered By.10.Yes.the Direction of a Ceiling Fan s Rotation Matters in Summer vs.WinterShareNextStay.\\n Claim:.John Lennon once asserted that Ringo Starr \"wasn\\'t even the best drummer in the Beatles.\".\\n Rating:.Misattributed.\\n About this rating.\\n During the height of Beatlemania in the mid\\n1960s, debates about the virtues of individual members of the Fab Four tended to take place among their young female fans, who focused on questions such which Beatle was the cutest, the funniest, or would make the best husband.\\n\\n As the Beatles made the transition from teenage idols to pop music legends, debates about the individual members shifted to more substantive matters, such as pondering which one was the best singer or best songwriter or best instrumentalist.\\n\\n https:\\nyoutu.be\\nb5rpAqfd35Q\\nIn the \"best instrumentalist\" category, arguments over Ringo Starr\\'s drumming prowess were often polarized between two camps: those who believed Ringo to be one of the best rock drummers ever, and those who viewed him as an ordinary talent (at best) who lucked out in being tapped to join a group of three vastly superior musicians.\\n Proponents of the latter viewpoint often cited a purported quote from John Lennon himself in which Lennon supposedly scoffed at the notion of Ringo as the best drummer of all time, quipping: \"The best drummer in the world?\\n Ringo wasn’t even the best drummer in the Beatles!\\n \"\\nIt\\'s unlikely Lennon would ever have said such a thing and meant it seriously, as he — along with the other Beatles — typically spoke fondly and positively of Ringo, both as a person and as a drummer.\\n In the famous Playboy interview conducted just a few months before his murder in 1980, for example, Lennon responded as follows when asked for his opinion of Ringo\\'s musicianship:Advertisement:\\nPLAYBOY: \"Let\\'s move on to Ringo.\\n What\\'s your opinion of him musically?\"\\nLENNON:\\n \"Ringo was a star in his own right in Liverpool before we even met.\\n He was a professional drummer who sang and performed and had Ringo Starr\\ntime, and he was in one of the top groups in Britain but especially in Liverpool before we even had a drummer.\\n So Ringo\\'s talent would have come out one way or the other as something or other.\\n I don\\'t know what he would have ended up as, but whatever that spark is in Ringo that we all know but can\\'t put our finger on ... whether it is acting, drumming or singing, I don\\'t know ...\\n there is something in him that is projectable and he would have surfaced with or without the Beatles.\\n Ringo is a damn good drummer.\\n I think Paul and Ringo stand up with any of the rock musicians.\\n\\n Those who have tried to run the alleged criticism of Lennon\\'s to ground have found it to be sourceless, something that has not turned up in any known audio recording, interview transcript, or primary reporting on Lennon and the Beatles, as renowned Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn noted in an interview with the Los Angeles Times:\\nAs part of his in\\ndepth research, Lewisohn also has debunked a humorous knock on Starr’s drumming abilities, long attributed to John Lennon.\\n For decades, people and media outlets have repeated the anecdote about Lennon being asked whether he considered Starr to be the best drummer in the world.\\n The oft\\nquoted response: “He’s not even the best drummer in the Beatles.”\\nWhile it sounds like the kind of acerbic comment that might have come out of Lennon’s mouth, Lewisohn says no.\\n\\n “The London Times newspaper quoted John Lennon ‘famously saying that Ringo wasn’t even the best drummer in the Beatles.’\\n John Lennon never said that, famously or otherwise, and that is the London Times quoting him,” Lewisohn said, making a point about his motivation for trying to separate fact from Fab Four mythology.\\n\\n I’ve heard every John Lennon interview, I’ve read every John Lennon interview, I never saw that quote.\\n he said.\\n “I determined to get to the bottom of it ...\\n John Lennon never said it \\n and wouldn’t have said it.”\\n\\n Those who have sought the true origins of this quip have commonly attributed it to a 1983 television appearance by British comedian Jasper Carrott.\\n

interview about how she thought the country\\'s immigration laws should be executed, particularly when it came to children of undocumented immigrants, according to Mediaite.\\n In the exchange with CNN host and reporter Christiane Amanpour, Clinton was not speaking specifically about \"dreamers,\" children who were brought to the United States by their parents and until recently have been allowed to remain and work in the country, but children who were coming along borders on their own.\\n \"We have to send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn\\'t mean the child gets to stay,\" the former secretary of state said.\\n \"So, we don\\'t want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey.\\n \"Amanpour then asked: \"So, you\\'re saying they should be sent back now?Newsweek Newsletter sign\\nup >Related Stories\\nBernie Sanders on Colbert: Trump, Hillary and Medicare\"Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back,\" Clinton responded.\\n \"But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families.\"Before\\n that exchange, Clinton explained that an increase in immigration at that time had to do with violence in some Central American countries and authorities there being unable to properly curtail it.\\n At the time, Clinton was promoting her book Hard Choices, and she was not too far away from announcing her bid for the 2016 presidential race.\\n And the report notes that while on the campaign trail Clinton said she wanted \"comprehensive immigration\" reform and would also \"fight to protect\" immigrants covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans acts ordered under President Barack Obama.\\n The latter was enacted—while DAPA was struck down in federal court—but President Donald Trump\\'s administration announced Wednesday that the program would be nixed.\\n Trump did, though, state that he \"loved\" the 800,000 so\\ncalled Dreamers and hoped Congress would take action in protecting them from possible deportation.\\n Newsweek subscription offers >Clinton\\'s latest book, What Happened, will be released Tuesday.\\n It details Clinton\\'s

Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) January 11, 2021.The FactsIn cases like this, it is imperative to make a distinction between the First Amendment and the more general concept of free, unregulated speech.\\n Twitter banning Trump\\'s account does not violate the First Amendment.\\n Nor does it remove the right to the freedom of speech from the Constitution.\\n The amendment states:\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\\n civil rights lawyer Nora Benavidez wrote in a tweet, the amendment prohibits the government from restricting speech based on the viewpoint expressed in that speech.\\n Twitter is a private company, not the government, and therefore is not subject to the First Amendment.\\n The First Amendment protects freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, & the right to petition the government for redress.\\n It prohibits gov’t restrictions on speech based on the viewpoint of that speech.\\n Twitter is not the government.\\n This is not a First Amendment violation.\\n — Nora Benavidez (@AttorneyNora) January 9, 2021\\n\"The First Amendment protects freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, & the right to petition the government for redress,\" she wrote.\\n \"It prohibits gov\\'t restrictions on speech based on the viewpoint of that speech.\\n Twitter is not the government.\\n This is not a First Amendment violation.\\n \"There are exceptions to the First Amendment\\'s free speech protections.\\n In the 1919 Supreme Court case Schenck v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes concluded that the Frist Amendment does not protect against speech that creates a \"clear and present danger of a significant evil.\"\\n If people promote violence or harm against others, that speech is exempt from First Amendment protections.\\n The 1969 case Brandenburg v. Ohio expanded the clear and present danger test by stating speech that \"is directed at inciting or producing imminent lawless action\" and is \"likely to incite or produce such action\" is not protected in the Constitution.\\n So what power does Twitter, and social media companies like it, have over regulating speech on their site?According to Twitter\\'s own company rules, their purpose is \"to serve the public conversation\" so that all people can participate in that conversation \"freely and safely.\"\\n Therefore, \"violence, harassment and other similar types of behavior discourage people from expressing themselves, and ultimately diminish the value of global public conversation.\\n \"Trump has called to repeal the law because he believes it allows social media companies to censor speech on their platforms and eliminating it would garner more free speech on the internet.\\n Last May, an executive order about preventing online censorship was issued, which stated, \"section 230 was not intended to allow a handful of companies to grow into titans controlling vital avenues for our national discourse under the guise of promoting open forums for debate, and then to provide those behemoths blanket immunity when they use their power to censor content and silence viewpoints that they dislike.\\n \"Others have been critical of social media platforms for not doing enough to punish abusive behavior on their apps.\\n Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the Senate Commerce Committee in October.\\n Section 230, platforms could potentially be held liable for everything people say,\" he said.\\n This is akin to the telephone company saying that we\\'ve been listening to a conversation and we\\'re not going to allow conversations that we consider to be misinformation or threatening.\\n Trump has not been officially charged with inciting the violence that occurred during the January 6 raid of the Capitol, many pundits and politicians have labeled it as such.\\n it is clear that another account is being used for the purposes of evading a ban, it is also subject to suspension,\" Twitter said in a statement to CNN.\\n \"Twitter\\'s policy prohibits Trump from directing a third party to operate a Twitter account on his behalf.\\n Twitter is not a government entity and therefore is not subject to the restrictions outlined in the

plenty of presidential campaign advertising of late, but the Washington Post yesterday highlighted a striking new ad from a PAC linked to VoteVets, the progressive veterans\\' group.\\n The father of a Navy SEAL who died in battle days after President Trump took office has condemned the president in a new political ad, saying that Americans should not trust the president with their lives or those of their children.\\n William Owens\\' son, Senior Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens, was the first person to die in combat during the Trump presidency following a Jan. 29, 2017, raid in Yemen.\\n \"Just\\n five days into his presidency, Trump ordered Ryan\\'s SEAL team into Yemen, not in the situation room with all the intelligence assembled, but sitting across a dinner table from Steve Bannon,\" Owens tells viewers as the narrator of the ad.\\n \"There was no vital interest at play, just Donald Trump playing big man going to war.\\n \"He concludes, \"If you hear one thing, let it be this: Don\\'t trust Donald Trump with your kid\\'s life \\n or your own.\\n \"The ad was released to coincide with the president\\'s remarks at the Republican National Convention last night.\\n If this story sounds at all familiar, it may because Trump pointed to Owens\\' death in the Republican\\'s first congressional address, about a month after his inauguration.\\n\\n \\nIran\\'s foreign

during the Obama administration,\\xa0informed him of more than 200 Israeli operations in Syria.\\n Kerry has previously been accused of colluding with Iranian leaders to undermine the Trump administration.\\n Kerry is now a part of the Biden administration and has a seat on the National Security Council as the special presidential envoy for climate.\\n Kerry shocked Zarif by revealing that Israel had attacked Iranian targets in Syria more than 200 times, according to leaked audio obtained by The New York Times\\xa0and other outlets.\\xa0\\n Zarif also\\xa0spoke frankly about his limited power compared to Ayatollah Ali Khameini and the blow the U.S. dealt to Iran by killing Gen.\\xa0Qassem Soleimani in January 2020.\\xa0\\n Kerry was ratting out Israeli covert operations in Syria directly to the Iranian foreign minister.\\n Let that sink in.\\n Wow,\" Noah Pollak of the foreign policy\\nfocused Democratic Alliance Group wrote on Twitter.\\n Former special advisor for Iran at the State Department Gabriel Noronha weighed in on Zarif\\'s lasting political career, despite his differences with others in Iranian governnment.\\n \"The main reason Zarif has survived as Foreign Minister for 8 years in Iran’s cutthroat political environment is that he serves as the ‘reasonable’ storefront to the world, protecting the more empowered radical elements of the regime from Western and press scrutiny,\" Noronha said in a statement..\\n Iran\\'s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif prepares to address the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, at United Nations headquarters, Wednesday, July 17, 2019.\\n \"Most of the time, Zarif’s Foreign Ministry is relegated to the job of the marketing and PR team, justifying and defending the policy choices of the IRGC and Supreme Leader Khamenei abroad,\" he continued.\\xa0\\n \"I think the leak was likely instigated by regime insiders who have long hated Zarif and tried to oust him —\\xa0they oppose current efforts to rejoin the JCPOA and also want to bolster domestic opposition to President Rouhani and his allies running for office in June.\\n release of the comments by\\xa0Zarif set off a firestorm within Iran, where officials carefully mind their words amid a cutthroat political environment that includes the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, ultimately overseen by the country\\'s supreme leader.\\n Zarif has been suggested as a possible candidate for Iran\\'s June 18 presidential election as well..\\n In this September file photo, Secretary of State John Kerry, left, meets with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at United Nations headquarters.\\n Outside of Iran, Zarif\\'s comments could also affect talks in Vienna aimed at finding a way for Tehran and the U.S. to both come into compliance with Iran\\'s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.\\n He told journalists on Monday that the recording represented just a portion of a seven\\nhour interview Zarif gave to a well\\nknown economist that was to be held for posterity by a think tank associated with the Iranian presidency.\\n Zarif, visiting Iraq on Monday after a trip to Qatar, took no questions

administration ordered it to display only Fox News on TVs.by Oliver Darcy.@oliverdarcy.\\n May 5, 2017: 5:36 PM ET.The Food and Drug Administration on Friday denied it was ordered by the Trump administration to display only Fox News on television sets in common areas at its Maryland campus..\"There was no directive or memorandum from the administration\\xa0that went out to employees about broadcast news channels displaying on monitors in common areas throughout the FDA\\'s White Oak campus,\" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement, adding that \"a variety of news stations run on those monitors, including CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News.\".\\n Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a spokesperson for the White House, added to CNN that \"it is certainly not White House policy\" to mandate television sets in the FDA be tuned into Fox News.\\n Sanders said she was unaware of any such directive being issued from the White House..\\n In an email sent to a listserv on Wednesday to employees at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, a research center at the FDA, a representative for the agency\\'s Office of Facilities said, \"The current administration ... has requested that all monitors, under our control, on the White Oak Campus, display Fox News.\".\\n \"Sorry for the inconvenience, but I am unable to change any of the monitors to any other news source at this time,\" wrote the representative, Christopher Stumphy.\\n He did not respond to a request for comment..\\n A spokesperson for the FDA declined to say why the email was sent out from the Office of Facilities..Related: Fox News fight moves to U.K..\\n The message from Stumphy, however, appeared to have been prompted by an email sent on Tuesday to the same listserv, which is made up of scientists and researchers within the FDA..\\n In that email, obtained by CNN, a supervisory medical officer wrote to colleagues about how he found it \"particularly odious to be confronted with Fox News telecasts\" at the scientific facility and floated the idea of a protest against the move..\\n The email generated dozens of responses, a person familiar with the exchange said.\\n One person who responded wrote that Fox News, the cable news network that generally provides the most favorable coverage to President Trump and his administration, was \"inappropriate\" and \"unacceptable\" because of its \"political bias.\".\\n A big winner in Trump\\'s first 100 days?\\n The White Oak campus is a large FDA facility which houses several large buildings and laboratories..\\n CNN\\'s Dylan Byers, Ross Levitt and

during the Trump presidency following a Jan. 29, 2017, raid in Yemen.\\n \"Just\\n five days into his presidency, Trump ordered Ryan\\'s SEAL team into Yemen, not in the situation room with all the intelligence assembled, but sitting across a dinner table from Steve Bannon,\" Owens tells viewers as the narrator of the ad.\\n \"There was no vital interest at play, just Donald Trump playing big man going to war.\\n \"The ad was released to coincide with the president\\'s remarks at the Republican National Convention last night.\\n If this story sounds at all familiar, it may because Trump pointed to Owens\\' death in the Republican\\'s first congressional address, about a month after his inauguration.\\n\\n \\nA white woman called police on black people barbecuing.\\n This is how the

News.\\n Former Obama campaign staffer argues Biden\\'s gaffes are a non\\nissue\\n A former spokesman for the Obama\\nBiden 2008 campaign says voters would rather have a candidate who says things he regrets instead of President Trump who does things he regrets.\\n Former President Barack Obama, discussing Joe Biden\\'s run for the high office in 2020, reportedly told his vice president that\\xa0he didn\\'t \"have to do this.\\n \"“You don’t have to do this, Joe, you really don’t,” Obama told Biden early in 2019, according to The New York Times.\\xa0\\n The Times reported that Obama \"took pains to cast his doubts about the campaign in personal terms.\\n \"Biden, who leads\\xa0President Trump in several polls on 2020 matchups, said he couldn\\'t forgive himself if he passed up the opportunity to beat Trump.\\n He initially thought he could beat Trump in 2016, but Obama reportedly pushed back because, in part, he thought former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be more effective in continuing his legacy, according to the report.\\n Speculation has swirled over the decision by Obama to so far refrain from endorsing Biden formally.\\n Still, despite Obama\\'s early hesitation, he has taken a much more involved role in Biden\\'s campaign than in that of other candidates\\', The Times reported.\\n IT OR HE CAN\\'T\\' VideoBiden has also invoked Obama, America\\'s\\xa0first black president, while defending himself against racism accusations\\xa0on the campaign trail.\\n But he has for years faced scrutiny over his views on race.\\n In January of 2007, he famously said that Obama was\\xa0“the first mainstream African\\nAmerican who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice\\nlooking guy.”\\n Obama\\xa0laughed the remark off, according to The Times.\\n Despite Obama\\'s widespread popularity among Democrats, the former president appeared to become somewhat of a liability for his friend.\\n CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDuring the second round of primary debates, Biden faced criticism over the number of deportations under the Obama administration.\\n The Affordable Care Act,\\xa0Obama\\'s signature legislative achievement, also came under fire from candidates who said it had fallen short.\\n While Obama has stayed relatively quiet during the 2020 race, some of his former officials have cautioned against using the former administration to attack Biden during the primaries..Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\\n\\n Arrives Tuesdays.\\n

Board of Education Supreme Court ruling, and the proliferation of bans on same\\nsex marriages as examples.\\n\\n “That’s what they always say,” Carson told Fox News.\\n “Everything is like Jim Crow.\\n Everything is like racism and segregation and slavery.\\n What a bunch of crap.\\n You know, they want to do that so that they can always gain the sympathy, but thinking people know better.”\\n\\n The retired neurosurgeon accused the federal government of overstepping its boundaries, adding that North Carolina “appropriately” filed suit.\\n\\n “You know, we need to go back to recognizing data and science.\\n You know, we know what men are, and we know what women are, and we’ve known that for thousands of years,” Carson said.\\n “You know, if there are some people who are confused about it, we can make some accommodations for them, but it doesn’t have to involve everybody.”.\\n Filed under:.North Carolina,.\\n Jim Crow,.\\n Ben Carson,.\\n Loretta Lynch,.\\n

hearings of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack against the U.S. Capitol have unfolded, new polling suggests.\\n While polls have generally shown the former president as the clear frontrunner for the Republican Party\\'s nomination, his viability might be taking a hit as the January 6 hearings feature what many view as damning testimony by his own former administration officials and other Republicans.\\n Polling data by Reuters\\nIpsos released on Thursday shows that Trump is losing support among GOP voters for a 2024 presidential run.\\n Survey data collected from July 20 to 21 showed that about one\\nthird (32 percent) of Republicans \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" agreed with the statement that Trump \"should NOT run for president again in 2024.\"\\n That was an increase from about one\\nquarter (26 percent) who said the same just six weeks ago.\\n\\n Former President Donald Trump appears to be losing support among GOP voters for another White House bid, according to new polling.\\n Above, Trump speaks during a Save America rally in Anchorage, Alaska, on July 9, 2022..\\n Additionally, in the previous early\\nJune poll, 51 percent of Republicans \"strongly\" disagreed with the statement that Trump shouldn\\'t seek another term.\\n That level of strong disapproval with the statement dipped 10 points to 41 percent in the latest survey.\\n Relatedly, the level of Republicans who believe Trump is at least partially responsible for January 6 has increased as well.\\n In June, one\\nthird (33 percent) \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" agreed with the statement that the former president is at least \"partly to blame for starting\" the Capitol riot.\\n In July, that amount has increased to 40 percent.\\n Among GOP respondents to the July survey, 9 percent said Trump was \"fully\" responsible for January 6, while 15 percent said \"largely\" and 29 percent said \"partially.\"\\n At the same time, a majority of Republicans still expressed belief in Trump\\'s misinformation, with 55 percent saying that they \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" agree that the 2020 election was stolen.\\n However, that level has gone down 11 points in six weeks.\\n\\n Read more.\\n Pence\\'s Chances of Beating Trump in 2024 as They Face Off in Arizona: Polls.\\n Trump Still Beats Biden in 2024 Rematch Despite Jan. 6 Hearings:

Images\\nLightRocket via Getty ImagesFloridaFlorida Advances Bill\\n That Would Ban Making White People Feel Bad About Racism, and No, That’s Not a JokeThe bill would ban public schools and private businesses from inflicting “discomfort” on white people during lessons or training about discrimination.\\n By Bess LevinJanuary 21, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailSave StoryFacebookTwitterEmailSave StoryQuick question for the group: Despite constantly claiming liberals are easily “triggered” “snowflakes,” are Republicans actually the most ridiculously sensitive people on earth?\\n So much so that they can’t stand the idea of factually accurate conversations about race in this country that might paint white people in an uncomfortable light?\\n And are now going so far as to try to effectively ban said conversations, because sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling “LA LA LA LA CAN’T HEAR YOU” when the topic comes up isn’t working?\\n On Tuesday, a bill backed by Florida governor Ron DeSantis that would prohibit public schools and private businesses from inflicting “discomfort” on white people during lessons or training about discrimination was approved by the state’s Senate Education Committee, its first hurdle before becoming a law.\\n The bill, SB 148, seemingly grew out of the conservative hysteria over “critical race theory,”\\xa0which, as a reminder, is an academic concept based on the idea that racism is not about individual people’s prejudices but about institutions and policies.\\n It does not, as GOP lawmakers and their partners in the right\\nwing media would have us believe, teach that all white people are racist.\\n (As another reminder, teaching CRT is not actually being required in elementary, middle, or high schools, but you wouldn’t know that by watching Fox News, which would have viewers believe that teachers are telling white kindergarteners to turn over their allowance as reparations.)\\n The bill, sponsored by State Senator Manny Diaz Jr., reads, in part, “An individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, does not bear responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex.\\n An individual should not be made to feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race.”THE\\n HIVE NEWSLETTERDaily updates from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley.\\n Your emailSUBMITBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie StatementDemocrats have argued that such a bill would lead to frivolous lawsuits and basically equate to censorship.\\n When asked for real\\nlife examples of schools or businesses telling students or employees that they are inherently racist because of the color of their skin, their Republican counterparts could come up with none.\\n “This bill\\'s not for Blacks, this bill was not for any other race,” said State Senator Shevrin Jones.\\n “This was directed to make whites not feel bad about what happened years ago.\\n At no point did anyone say white people should be held responsible for what happened, but what I would ask my white counterparts is, are you an enabler of what happened, or are you going to say we must talk about history?”\\n At a news conference last month, DeSantis, who has designs on the White House in 2024, called critical race theory “crap” and vowed to pass legislation allowing parents to sue schools and employees to sue employers if they are made to listen to such a thing.\\n “You think about what MLK stood for.\\n He said he didn’t want people judged on the color of their skin but on the content of their character,” DeSantis said at the time.\\n “You listen to some of these people nowadays, they don’t talk about that.“\\n (Naturally, the governor, like other MLK\\nquoting Republicans, chose not to focus on the fact that King regularly reminded America of its racist roots and said things\\xa0like, “The Republican Party geared its appeal and program to racism, reaction, and extremism.\\n ”)Anyway, as MSNBC’s Ja’han Jones notes, this whole bill is about “prioritizing white hypersensitivity over truthful teachings” and saying “lessons about America’s racist and sexist past are acceptable only if they don’t offend white people.”\\n And, according to Jones, it’s nothing new!To me, these new demands for fealty to fragile whiteness sound like a re\\nup of the Black Codes, laws instituted during and after the Civil War to reinforce white supremacy.\\n In some states, the codes\\xa0permitted capital punishment against Black people for minor crimes like petty theft, allowed whippings for vagrancy and swearing, and banned Black land ownership.\\n Florida’s particularly harsh codes allowed white people to beat Black workers for “disrespect,” as historian Jerrell H. Shofner\\xa0wrote\\xa0in his 1976 essay on the state’s racist laws.\\n Historian Joe M. Richardson wrote that white Floridians passed the codes out of fear that their racist world was crumbling around them.\\xa0\\n They see the facade of white supremacy—weak as it is—crumbling under the weight of high school lesson plans and workplace trainings.\\n And bills like SB 148 are sad attempts to piece that facade back together....\\n That’s why—if the\\xa0white parents complaining about Black authors\\xa0weren’t enough—it’s clear that the Florida bill is designed to coddle white people, even though it doesn’t mention them specifically.\\xa0\\n Most PopularThe Idaho Murders, Part 1:

Left in removing my account from their platform, to silence me — and YOU, the 75,000,000 great patriots who voted for me.\\n \"The\\n tweets disappeared from the @POTUS account almost immediately.\\n Representative Matt Gaetz (R\\nFla.) claimed that Twitter\\'s company policies were at odds with the Constitution, insinuating that banning Trump\\'s account violated his First Amendment rights.\\n We cannot live in a world where Twitter’s terms of service are more important than the terms in our Constitution and Bill of Rights.—\\n Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) January 11, 2021.The FactsIn cases like this, it is imperative to make a distinction between the First Amendment and the more general concept of free, unregulated speech.\\n Twitter banning Trump\\'s account does not violate the First Amendment.\\n Nor does it remove the right to the freedom of speech from the Constitution.\\n The amendment states:\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\\n civil rights lawyer Nora Benavidez wrote in a tweet, the amendment prohibits the government from restricting speech based on the viewpoint expressed in that speech.\\n Twitter is a private company, not the government, and therefore is not subject to the First Amendment.\\n The First Amendment protects freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, & the right to petition the government for redress.\\n It prohibits gov’t restrictions on speech based on the viewpoint of that speech.\\n Twitter is not the government.\\n This is not a First Amendment violation.\\n — Nora Benavidez (@AttorneyNora) January 9, 2021\\n\"The First Amendment protects freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, & the right to petition the government for redress,\" she wrote.\\n \"It prohibits gov\\'t restrictions on speech based on the viewpoint of that speech.\\n Twitter is not the government.\\n This is not a First Amendment violation.\\n \"There are exceptions to the First Amendment\\'s free speech protections.\\n In the 1919 Supreme Court case Schenck v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes concluded that the Frist Amendment does not protect against speech that creates a \"clear and present danger of a significant evil.\"\\n The 1969 case Brandenburg v. Ohio expanded the clear and present danger test by stating speech that \"is directed at inciting or producing imminent lawless action\" and is \"likely to incite or produce such action\" is not protected in the Constitution.\\n So what power does Twitter, and social media companies like it, have over regulating speech on their site?According to Twitter\\'s own company rules, their purpose is \"to serve the public conversation\" so that all people can participate in that conversation \"freely and safely.\"\\n If a tweet violates this policy, the account will be suspended immediately and permanently.\\n Additionally, users cannot glorify, celebrate, praise or condone violent crimes or events where people were targeted because of their membership in a protected group, like race, gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation.\\n \"Trump has called to repeal the law because he believes it allows social media companies to censor speech on their platforms and eliminating it would garner more free speech on the internet.\\n Last May, an executive order about preventing online censorship was issued, which stated, \"section 230 was not intended to allow a handful of companies to grow into titans controlling vital avenues for our national discourse under the guise of promoting open forums for debate, and then to provide those behemoths blanket immunity when they use their power to censor content and silence viewpoints that they dislike.\\n \"Others have been critical of social media platforms for not doing enough to punish abusive behavior on their apps.\\n Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the Senate Commerce Committee in October.\\n \"Platforms would likely censor more content to avoid legal risk and would be less likely to invest in technologies that enable people to express themselves in new ways.\"Twitter\\n When Twitter began flagging Trump\\'s tweets for being false, misleading or otherwise violating their terms, the president also called it an infringement on his rights.\\n This is akin to the telephone company saying that we\\'ve been listening to a conversation and we\\'re not going to allow conversations that we consider to be misinformation or threatening.\\n On December 24, 2020, Trump tweeted: \"Twitter is going wild with their flags, trying hard to suppress even the truth.\\n Cancel Culture at its worst.\\n

November 18, 2015\\nFind Out More >70,468.Yeah…but those darn White kids…\\nIs there a need for some sort of White Student Union?\\n I’m sure we could have a debate about that which would drag on for years.\\n In a more existential sense, one might argue that there are problems unique to white students, such as quota systems which undermine merit based acceptance rates or the availability of certain grants and loan programs which are race based and exclude large numbers of people from consideration.\\n But on a day to day basis, complaining that white students are somehow discriminated against by university policy is a bit of a stretch and could set such a hypothetical student union up for ridicule, if not failure, because of the accepted conventional wisdom.\\n\\n But that’s really the point here, isn’t it?\\n Why is it always accepted that the existence of a black student union or an Asian student union or one for women, Jews, Muslims or anyone else is the routine business of the day, but the suggestion of a white student union is immediately painted as abhorrent?\\n Even if you’re making the argument that “it’s simply not needed” then you have to show us why that’s a disqualifying factor.\\n A football team isn’t “needed” either if the goal of a university is to educate young minds and prepare them for the adult world, but pretty much every college in America has one.\\n\\n Then there’s the question of Black Lives Matter, which seemed to spur this proposal whether it be fake or real.\\n The creators of the supposed White Student Union overplay their hand considerably when their opening gambit is to label BLM as “terrorists” but the underlying text voices complaints about constant disruptions to studies and the normal affairs of campus life.\\n Is that an unreasonable charge?\\n As we’ve seen with BLM protests all over the country, their primary goal is disruption of white spaces.\\n (Their phrasing, not mine.)\\n Should the campus be regularly disrupted when there are students there who are paying large sums of money to get an education, a degree and hopefully a shot at a good career?\\n\\n But perhaps the most challenging prospect of a discussion over a proposal like this would be to have everyone look in the mirror and ask themselves why we focus so heavily on segregating ourselves into all of these demographic pigeonholes to begin with.\\n Rather than asking if we should ban a White Student Union, perhaps someone could ask why colleges encourage all of these other student groups based on race, gender and religion.\\n Wasn’t the goal to have a unified, color\\nblind society, free of discrimination based on all of these qualifiers?\\n And if we must insist on segregated pride, perhaps it’s also worth asking why anything organized with the word “white” in it is immediately defined as racist and evil when no other qualifier is treated in that fashion.\\n You FED UP?If you are fed up with the mainstream media\\'s lies,

Mike Huckabee said last week that he never supported or defended Josh Duggar after allegations surfaced in May that the former reality TV star had molested his sisters as a teenager.\\n \"I really didn\\'t support Josh,\" Huckabee told Iowa radio host Simon Conway on Dec. 23.\\n \"I supported his parents, if you\\'ll go back and look at what I said.\\n There\\'s no support for what he did.\\n \"Huckabee has long enjoyed the political support of the Duggar family and said as recently as June that he would be open to having them join his presidential campaign.\\n On May 22, he wrote a Facebook post condemning Josh Duggar\\'s actions, but saying he did not think they were \"unforgivable.\"\"Josh\\'s actions when he was an underage teen are as he described them himself, \\'inexcusable,\\' but that doesn\\'t mean \\'unforgivable,\\'\" Huckabee said.\\n \"He and his family dealt with it and were honest and open about it with the victims and the authorities.\\n No purpose whatsoever is served by those who are now trying to discredit Josh or his family by sensationalizing the story.\\n Good people make mistakes and do regrettable and even disgusting things.\\n the time, Huckabee suggested that Josh Duggar\\'s behavior was a result of the immature judgment of a minor.\\n \"The reason that the law protects disclosure of many actions on the part of a minor is that the society has traditionally understood something that today\\'s blood\\nthirsty media does not understand—that being a minor means that one\\'s judgement is not mature,\" he said.\\n \"No one needs to defend Josh\\'s actions as a teenager, but the fact that he confessed his sins to those he harmed, sought help, and has gone forward to live a responsible and circumspect life as an adult is testament to his family\\'s authenticity and humility.\\n \"In last week\\'s Iowa radio interview, Huckabee repeated his criticism of the media for what he characterized as its exploitation of Josh Duggar\\'s sisters, but but added that he felt their brother\\'s behavior was \"despicable\" and \"dishonest.\"\\n \"I think in subsequent months, as more things came out, what he did was despicable, it was dishonest,\" Huckabee said.\\n \"He did some things that totally defy everything he supposedly stood for.\\n But he certainly defied what his parents not only have stood for, but continue to.\\n So my support was for his sisters, who were the real victims; I felt like they were being exploited by the media.\\n never defended Josh, and I don\\'t defend him now, because there\\'s nothing to defend,\" he added.\\n What he did was absolutely hideously wrong and despicable.\"\\n Before the report that he had molested his sisters came out, Duggar was also executive director of the Family Research Council\\'s FRC Action group, a position he subsequently resigned.\\n\\n Christopher MassieBuzzFeed News ReporterChristopher Massie is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.\\n Contact Christopher Massie at Christopher.\\n Got a confidential tip?\\n 👉 Submit it here.incomingYour weekday morning guide to breaking news, cultural analysis, and everything in betweenNewsletter signup formEmail\\n AddressSign upThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\\n Be one of the first to comment.\\n\\n president is very supportive of the Senate bill.\\n There’s a lot of ideas in there \\n \\n he’s talked about having heart,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters when asked if Trump preferred the Senate’s draft to a bill to repeal Obamacare approved by the House of Representatives.\\n “I think he’s very pleased with that (Senate) bill and he wants to continue to push it forward,” Spicer said.\\n Reporting by Steve Holland;

Kennedy’s assassin.\\n “Our country is in crisis.\\n Hillary Clinton is manifestly unfit to be president, and her policies would harm millions of Americans.\\n And Donald Trump is the only thing

Graham wrote on Twitter.\\n \"The U.S. now has no leverage and Syria will eventually become a nightmare for Israel.\"\\n He also lamented the fate of the Kurds, a group which has been backed by the

helping to get President Donald Trump elected.\\n\\n Speaking to Butowsky by phone on Thursday evening, he told the Gateway Pundit that during a conversation with Joel Rich on December 17, 2016 at 3:17 p.m., the father stated “we know what our sons did, but we just want to find Seth’s killer.”\\n\\n “They know — we all know,”\\xa0Butowksy said.\\n\\n In an audio recording that I previously obtained, private investigator Rod Wheeler explained that Seth’s brother, Aaron Rich, had tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth’s computer — even though there could be evidence on it.\\n\\n Wheeler said that Seth’s girlfriend told him that Aaron Rich had possession of Seth’s cell phones, but Aaron denied it and said “we’re not going to worry about the cell phones.”\\nAaron also blocked Wheeler from finding out about who was at a party Seth attended the night of the murder.\\n\\n “All I want you to do is work on the botched robbery theory and that’s it,” Aaron told Wheeler, according to Wheeler’s claim on the audio.\\n Wheeler said that Seth’s father Joel “does not appear to have any hidden agenda.”\\n\\n “He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,” Wheeler said.\\n “I said, well can I look at it?…He said, what are you looking for?\\n I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone.\\n He said no, I already checked it.\\n Don’t worry about it.”\\nAaron Rich works for\\xa0Northrup Grumman, which was named as the fifth\\nlargest defense contractor in the world in 2015, as a lead software developer.\\n\\n “It’s not just hacking and defending, there’s a lot more to it,” a cyber software engineer at Northrup Grumman says in a video on the company’s website.\\n\\n An additional leaked phone conversation I previously obtained featured award winning journalist Sy Hersh confirming that Rich had made contact with WikiLeaks.\\n\\n “There are no DNC or Podesta emails that exist beyond May 21 or 22, last email from either one of those groups.\\n What the report says is that some time in late Spring… he makes contact with WikiLeaks, that’s in his computer,” he says.\\n “Anyway, they found what he had done is that he had submitted a series of documents — of emails, of juicy emails, from the DNC.”\\n\\n “All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I’m sure dozens of emails, and said ‘I want money.’\\n Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,” he said.\\n They got access to the DropBox.”\\nHersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him, and had shared the DropBox with trusted associates incase anything happened to him.\\n\\n “The word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that ‘if anything happens to me it’s not going to solve your problems,’” he added.\\n “WikiLeaks got access before he was killed.”.\\n Audio tape of Seymour Hersh discussing WikiLeaks DNC leaks and Seth Rich https:\\nt.co\\nSTp9u7Vtbn h\\nt @CassandraRules\\n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) August 1, 2017.In an email exchange that had been previously provided to me exclusively, Butowsky pleaded with Hersh to go to Congress with what he knew.\\n\\n “I am curious why you haven’t approached the house committee telling them what you were read by your FBI friend related to Seth Rich that you in turn read to me.\\n Based on all your work, it appears that you care about the truth.\\n Even though, as you said you couldn’t get a second, shouldn’t you tell them so they could use their powers to determine the truth?”\\n Butowsky asked.\\n\\n In a bizarre response completely contradicting what Hersh is heard saying on the audio recording, he denies having any inside knowledge of the case.\\n\\n “ed –you have a lousy memory…i was not read anything by my fbi friend..\\n i have no firsthand information and i really wish you would stop telling others information that you think i have…please stop relaying information that you do not have right…and that i.have no reason to believe is accurate…” Hersh wrote.\\n\\n Desperate to find the truth about what happened, Bukowsky continues to plead with the journalist to go forward.\\n\\n “I know it isn’t first hand knowledge but you clearly said, my memory is perfect, that you had a friend at the FBI who read \\n told you what was in the file on Seth Rich and I wonder why you aren’t helping your country and sharing that information on who it was?”\\n Interestingly, a new report published on Thursday evening by the Washington Times also confirms that Rich had downloaded thousands of DNC emails.\\n\\n “Another aspect that needs to be uncovered is the FBI’s ‘denial’ that its cyber experts who share space with the D.C. Metro police department at Cleveland Avenue in the District, assisted in accessing data on Mr. Rich’s laptop.\\n Not likely.\\n Data on the laptop revealed that Mr. Rich downloaded thousands of DNC emails and was in touch with Wikileaks.\\n The file with evidence of what was on Mr. Rich’s laptop sits with the FBI in a co\\nshared space with the D.C. police department.\\n According to Ed Butowsky, an acquaintance of the family, in his discussions with Joel and Mary Rich, they confirmed that their son transmitted the DNC emails to Wikileaks,” the Washinton Times reported.\\n\\n Rich was shot in the back in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016, near his home while he was on the phone with his girlfriend — 12 days before the publication of the DNC emails by WikiLeaks.\\n The police initially ruled that it was a botched robbery — but his wallet, watch, and necklace were still on his person when he was discovered by police.\\n\\n The\\xa0report\\xa0from the Washington Times points out that “the same day Seth Rich was murdered, an FBI agent’s car was burglarized in the same vicinity.\\n Included in the FBI equipment stolen was a 40 caliber Glock 22.\\n D.C.\\n Metro police issued a press release, declaring that the theft of the FBI agent’s car occurred between 5 and 7 a.m. Two weeks later, the FBI changed the time of the theft to between 12 a.m. and 2 a.m. Was the FBI gun used to shoot Seth Rich?\\n Neither the FBI nor the Metro police will discuss.”\\nLast July, Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) — a 30 member group made up of well respected former experts from the National Security Administration, tech companies and other intelligence agencies put out a\\xa0report\\xa0asserting that the DNC emails came from a leak, not a hack.\\n\\n VIPS stated that “forensic studies of ‘Russian hacking’ into Democratic National Committee computers last year reveal that on July 5, 2016, data was leaked (not hacked) by a person with physical access to DNC computer.\\n After examining metadata from the “Guccifer 2.0” July 5, 2016 intrusion into the DNC server, independent cyber investigators have concluded that an insider copied DNC data onto an external storage device.”\\n\\n Additionally, the former intelligence operatives detail how the FBI neglected to perform any independent forensics on the original “Guccifer 2.0,” and assert that “the reason the U.S. government lacks conclusive evidence of a transfer of a ‘Russian hack’ to WikiLeaks is because there was no such transfer.”\\nAmong those who signed on to the report is William Binney, former NSA Technical Director for World Geopolitical & Military Analysis; Co\\nfounder of NSA’s Signals Intelligence Automation Research Center, Larry C Johnson, who is retired from the CIA & State Department, Kirk Wiebe, former Senior Analyst at SIGINT Automation Research Center of the NSA, and many more.\\n\\n Though Assange has infamously expressed interest in Rich, he has always maintained that WikiLeaks will never name a source.\\n WikiLeaks has offered a $20,000 reward for Rich’s murderer however, and has retweeted articles that asserted he was their source without providing any additional comment..About Latest Posts Sean Adl\\nTabatabai.\\n COVID Vaccines Are Causing ‘Hyper\\nAccelerated Ageing’ in Humans \\n February 8, 2023.Bill Gates Declares It’s OK for Him To Use Private Jets Because He’s ‘Saving the Planet’ \\n February 8, 2023.Church of England Declares ‘Jesus Is Non\\nBinary’ \\n February 8, 2023.PreviousNew 9\\n11 Video Proves No Plane Hit Pentagon.Next‘Pharma Bro’ Martin Shkreli Begs Judge\\n President Trump Says Adam Schiff Should Be Arrested For Treason.\\n Peter Strzok Worked For The CIA Under Obama.July 17, 2018\\n41\\nLatest Video\\nSponsorship enquiries:sponsor@thepeoplesvoice.tv.\\n November 29, 2022\\n16.World War 3: Russia And Syria To Confront US Army In Raqqa.\\n January 19, 2021\\n2.Snakes\\n December 16, 2019\\nComments Off on Puerto Rico Governor Signs New Law\\n Eyewitness: I Saw CNN’s Don Lemon Sexually Assault Man in Bar.\\n October 13, 2018\\n2.Palestine secures observer status at the International Criminal Court.\\n December 9, 2014\\nComments Off on Palestine secures observer status at the International Criminal Court.\\n\\n By Llewellyn H.

government pressure, a panel of advertising consultants and executives said on Monday.\\n\\n Speaking at a trade conference, the marketers seized on allegations that Russian operatives bought U.S. political ads on Facebook as evidence that the sector cannot go on being unregulated.\\n\\n “I think there will be more scrutiny, and there better be more self\\nregulation.\\n Last week, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg vowed to do more to deter governments from using Facebook to manipulate elections in other countries, after the company disclosed US$100,000 in Russian ad purchases in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\\n\\n The 3,000 ads included some that highlighted support for Democrat Hillary Clinton among Muslim women, as well as others that showed a deep understanding of U.S. social divides, the Washington Post reported on Monday.\\n\\n Facebook shares ended down 4.5 per cent on Monday, closing at US$162.87, as some investors worried the tech sector had become too expensive.\\n\\n Zuckerberg has also unveiled sweeping changes to how his company handles political ads, saying it would make them visible to all users regardless of whom the ads target.\\n\\n Andrew Capone, senior vice president of NCC Media, a cable trade group, joked on Monday’s panel that during the 2016 election campaign, “Facebook took in over 300 million rubles \\n \\n I’m sorry, dollars.\\n ”\\nMcGoldrick said on the panel: “If I were Facebook and Google and everyone else, I would be developing a code of conduct and a set of criteria.\\n They may already exist, but obviously it’s not either robust enough or transparent enough.”\\nGoogle has said it has no evidence on its ad platform of a Russian propaganda campaign like the one Facebook found.\\n\\n The two Silicon Valley firms are set to take a combined 63 per cent of the U.S. market this year, according to research firm eMarketer.\\n\\n Though Facebook and Google have for years resisted regulation of political ads, congressional investigators and U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller have helped to change the situation, said Jefrey Pollock, president of public relations firm Global

Power of Being Honest in a World That Lies\"What do you say about a person who lies by dismissing the danger of something only to succumb to it?\\n I’m thinking of radio host Rush Limbaugh, who died this week at age 70 from lung cancer after denying that cigarette smoke was a serious health threat (it “takes 50 years to kill people, if it does,” he said) and smoking for decades.\\n People who have made a living out of spreading outrageous lies are generally not stupid.\\n What they are is experts at self\\ndeception.\\n That anyone gets cancer is tragic.\\n But I find it equally tragic that Limbaugh consistently sought to bend facts about public health to the reality he wanted to live in, and thereby endangered the listeners who believed him.\\n His downplaying of the dangers of smoking was merely a warmup for his participation in PolitiFact\\'s 2020 “lie of the year”: Covid\\n19 denial.\\n Limbaugh’s repeated lies about the coronavirus included everything from conspiracy theories involving Dr. Anthony Fauci to his suggestion that the virus was nothing more than a stunt by people opposed to President Donald Trump.\\n RelatedOpinionOpinionWhat liberals never understood about Rush Limbaugh\\'s appealAfter all, people who have made a living out of spreading outrageous lies are generally not stupid.\\n They are experts at self\\ndeception.\\n I know from writing a book about honesty — which was published just a month before Covid\\n19 exploded — that self\\ndeception is the strongest and most mysterious of all the deceptions.\\n With self\\ndeception, you’re both the teller and receiver of the lie.\\n That duality can strengthen and turn toxic the biases most of us work to keep in check.\\n One of those biases is simple overconfidence.\\n We are, it turns out, stunningly overconfident, especially when it comes to our intelligence.\\n For example, Yale University’s Zoe Chance has found that if you let people “accidentally” cheat on a difficult test by giving them an answer key, they will attribute their good performance to their intelligence.\\n In her study, the answer\\nkey group predicted they would do well on the next test even once they saw there was no answer key.\\n (They didn’t.)Rush Limbaugh, conservative radio host, dies at age 70Feb.\\n 17, 202103:01When people believe something about themselves, they don’t want to give it up, even in the face of evidence against their belief.\\n One of the key aspects behind this phenomenon is our use of “motivated reasoning.”\\n The definition of motivated reasoning I like best is writer Tim Harford’s, from a fascinating piece detailing how the world’s top authority on Dutch painters managed to convince himself a forged Johannes Vermeer painting was the real thing when it so obviously wasn’t.\\n “Motivated reasoning is thinking through a topic with the aim of reaching a particular conclusion,” Harford explains.\\n You know what you want to be true, so you let the outcome you desire guide your thinking.\\n If you’re certain that you’re smarter than most other people and you tune out all evidence that contradicts that, why wouldn’t you believe yourself?\\n This explains how blind spots become entrenched in one’s thinking.\\n But what motivates people to be deceptive to begin with?RelatedOpinionOpinionWe want to hear what you THINK.\\n\\n Florida Advances Bill That Would Ban

Feel Bad About Racism, and No, That’s Not a JokeThe bill would ban public schools and private businesses from inflicting “discomfort” on white people during lessons or training about discrimination.\\n By Bess LevinJanuary 21, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailSave StoryFacebookTwitterEmailSave StoryQuick question for the group: Despite constantly claiming liberals are easily “triggered” “snowflakes,” are Republicans actually the most ridiculously sensitive people on earth?\\n So much so that they can’t stand the idea of factually accurate conversations about race in this country that might paint white people in an uncomfortable light?\\n And are now going so far as to try to effectively ban said conversations, because sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling “LA LA LA LA CAN’T HEAR YOU” when the topic comes up isn’t working?\\n On Tuesday, a bill backed by Florida governor Ron DeSantis that would prohibit public schools and private businesses from inflicting “discomfort” on white people during lessons or training about discrimination was approved by the state’s Senate Education Committee, its first hurdle before becoming a law.\\n It does not, as GOP lawmakers and their partners in the right\\nwing media would have us believe, teach that all white people are racist.\\n (As another reminder, teaching CRT is not actually being required in elementary, middle, or high schools, but you wouldn’t know that by watching Fox News, which would have viewers believe that teachers are telling white kindergarteners to turn over their allowance as reparations.)\\n The bill, sponsored by State Senator Manny Diaz Jr., reads, in part, “An individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, does not bear responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex.\\n An individual should not be made to feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race.”THE\\n HIVE NEWSLETTERDaily updates from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley.\\n Your emailSUBMITBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie StatementDemocrats have argued that such a bill would lead to frivolous lawsuits and basically equate to censorship.\\n When asked for real\\nlife examples of schools or businesses telling students or employees that they are inherently racist because of the color of their skin, their Republican counterparts could come up with none.\\n “This bill\\'s not for Blacks, this bill was not for any other race,” said State Senator Shevrin Jones.\\n “This was directed to make whites not feel bad about what happened years ago.\\n At no point did anyone say white people should be held responsible for what happened, but what I would ask my white counterparts is, are you an enabler of what happened, or are you going to say we must talk about history?”\\n At a news conference last month, DeSantis, who has designs on the White House in 2024, called critical race theory “crap” and vowed to pass legislation allowing parents to sue schools and employees to sue employers if they are made to listen to such a thing.\\n Asked for comment by CBS News, the governor’s spokeswoman reiterated DeSantis’s embarrassing comments from the same news conference in which he suggested that Martin Luther King Jr. would be all for these Republican bills.\\n “You think about what MLK stood for.\\n He said he didn’t want people judged on the color of their skin but on the content of their character,” DeSantis said at the time.\\n “You listen to some of these people nowadays, they don’t talk about that.“\\n (Naturally, the governor, like other MLK\\nquoting Republicans, chose not to focus on the fact that King regularly reminded America of its racist roots and said things\\xa0like, “The Republican Party geared its appeal and program to racism, reaction, and extremism.\\n ”)Anyway, as MSNBC’s Ja’han Jones notes, this whole bill is about “prioritizing white hypersensitivity over truthful teachings” and saying “lessons about America’s racist and sexist past are acceptable only if they don’t offend white people.”\\n And, according to Jones, it’s nothing new!To me, these new demands for fealty to fragile whiteness sound like a re\\nup of the Black Codes, laws instituted during and after the Civil War to reinforce white supremacy.\\n In some states, the codes\\xa0permitted capital punishment against Black people for minor crimes like petty theft, allowed whippings for vagrancy and swearing, and banned Black land

staffer was murdered after leaking DNC emails to WikiLeaks..Ed Butowsky, the man who offered to assist the Rich family in finding the culprits for Seth’s murder, says that Seth Rich’s father confirmed to him that he\\xa0“knew what his son did.”\\nBYPASS THE CENSORS\\nSign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox.\\n\\n Email*.NameThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\\n\\n By subscribing you agree to our Terms of Use.Thegatewaypundit.com reports: Butowsky further stated that the family was deeply concerned with their son being remembered for helping to get President Donald Trump elected.\\n\\n Speaking to Butowsky by phone on Thursday evening, he told the Gateway Pundit that during a conversation with Joel Rich on December 17, 2016 at 3:17 p.m., the father stated “we know what our sons did, but we just want to find Seth’s killer.”\\n\\n “They know — we all know,”\\xa0Butowksy said.\\n\\n In an audio recording that I previously obtained, private investigator Rod Wheeler explained that Seth’s brother, Aaron Rich, had tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth’s computer — even though there could be evidence on it.\\n\\n Wheeler said that Seth’s girlfriend told him that Aaron Rich had possession of Seth’s cell phones, but Aaron denied it and said “we’re not going to worry about the cell phones.”\\nAaron also blocked Wheeler from finding out about who was at a party Seth attended the night of the murder.\\n\\n “All I want you to do is work on the botched robbery theory and that’s it,” Aaron told Wheeler, according to Wheeler’s claim on the audio.\\n Wheeler said that Seth’s father Joel “does not appear to have any hidden agenda.”\\n\\n “He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,” Wheeler said.\\n “I said, well can I look at it?…He said, what are you looking for?\\n I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone.\\n He said no, I already checked it.\\n Don’t worry about it.”\\nAaron Rich works for\\xa0Northrup Grumman, which was named as the fifth\\nlargest defense contractor in the world in 2015, as a lead software developer.\\n\\n “It’s not just hacking and defending, there’s a lot more to it,” a cyber software engineer at Northrup Grumman says in a video on the company’s website.\\n\\n An additional leaked phone conversation I previously obtained featured award winning journalist Sy Hersh confirming that Rich had made contact with WikiLeaks.\\n\\n “There are no DNC or Podesta emails that exist beyond May 21 or 22, last email from either one of those groups.\\n What the report says is that some time in late Spring… he makes contact with WikiLeaks, that’s in his computer,” he says.\\n “Anyway, they found what he had done is that he had submitted a series of documents — of emails, of juicy emails, from the DNC.”\\n\\n “All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I’m sure dozens of emails, and said ‘I want money.’\\n Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,” he said.\\n They got access to the DropBox.”\\nHersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him, and had shared the DropBox with trusted associates incase anything happened to him.\\n\\n “The word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that ‘if anything happens to me it’s not going to solve your problems,’” he added.\\n “WikiLeaks got access before he was killed.”.\\n “I am curious why you haven’t approached the house committee telling them what you were read by your FBI friend related to Seth Rich that you in turn read to me.\\n Based on all your work, it appears that you care about the truth.\\n Even though, as you said you couldn’t get a second, shouldn’t you tell them so they could use their powers to determine the truth?”\\n Butowsky asked.\\n\\n In a bizarre response completely contradicting what Hersh is heard saying on the audio recording, he denies having any inside knowledge of the case.\\n\\n “ed –you have a lousy memory…i was not read anything by my fbi friend..\\n i have no firsthand information and i really wish you would stop telling others information that you think i have…please stop relaying information that you do not have right…and that i.have no reason to believe is accurate…” Hersh wrote.\\n\\n Desperate to find the truth about what happened, Bukowsky continues to plead with the journalist to go forward.\\n\\n “I know it isn’t first hand knowledge but you clearly said, my memory is perfect, that you had a friend at the FBI who read \\n told you what was in the file on Seth Rich and I wonder why you aren’t helping your country and sharing that information on who it was?”\\n Bukowsky responds.\\n\\n Interestingly, a new report published on Thursday evening by the Washington Times also confirms that Rich had downloaded thousands of DNC emails.\\n\\n “Another aspect that needs to be uncovered is the FBI’s ‘denial’ that its cyber experts who share space with the D.C. Metro police department at Cleveland Avenue in the District, assisted in accessing data on Mr. Rich’s laptop.\\n Not likely.\\n Data on the laptop revealed that Mr. Rich downloaded thousands of DNC emails and was in touch with Wikileaks.\\n The file with evidence of what was on Mr. Rich’s laptop sits with the FBI in a co\\nshared space with the D.C. police department.\\n Rich was shot in the back in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016, near his home while he was on the phone with his girlfriend — 12 days before the publication of the DNC emails by WikiLeaks.\\n The police initially ruled that it was a botched robbery — but his wallet, watch, and necklace were still on his person when he was discovered by police.\\n\\n The\\xa0report\\xa0from the Washington Times points out that “the same day Seth Rich was murdered, an FBI agent’s car was burglarized in the same vicinity.\\n Included in the FBI equipment stolen was a 40 caliber Glock 22.\\n D.C.\\n Metro police issued a press release, declaring that the theft of the FBI agent’s car occurred between 5 and 7 a.m. Two weeks later, the FBI changed the time of the theft to between 12 a.m. and 2 a.m. Was the FBI gun used to shoot Seth Rich?\\n Neither the FBI nor the Metro police will discuss.”\\nLast July, Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) — a 30 member group made up of well respected former experts from the National Security Administration, tech companies and other intelligence agencies put out a\\xa0report\\xa0asserting that the DNC emails came from a leak, not a hack.\\n\\n VIPS stated that “forensic studies of ‘Russian hacking’ into Democratic National Committee computers last year reveal that on July 5, 2016, data was leaked (not hacked) by a person with physical access to DNC computer.\\n After examining metadata from the “Guccifer 2.0” July 5, 2016 intrusion into the DNC server, independent cyber investigators have concluded that an insider copied DNC data onto an external storage device.”\\n\\n Additionally, the former intelligence operatives detail how the FBI neglected to perform any independent forensics on the original “Guccifer 2.0,” and assert that “the reason the U.S. government lacks conclusive evidence of a transfer of a ‘Russian hack’ to WikiLeaks is because there was no such transfer.”\\nAmong those who signed on to the report is William Binney, former NSA Technical Director for World Geopolitical & Military Analysis; Co\\nfounder of NSA’s Signals Intelligence Automation Research Center, Larry C Johnson, who is retired from the CIA & State Department, Kirk Wiebe, former Senior Analyst at SIGINT Automation Research Center of the NSA, and many more.\\n\\n Though Assange has infamously expressed interest in Rich, he has always maintained that WikiLeaks will never name a source.\\n WikiLeaks has offered a $20,000 reward for Rich’s murderer however, and has retweeted articles that asserted he was their source without providing any additional comment..About Latest Posts Sean Adl\\nTabatabai.\\n COVID Vaccines Are Causing ‘Hyper\\nAccelerated Ageing’ in Humans \\n February 8, 2023.Bill Gates Declares It’s OK for Him To Use

Times News Service.\\n New York: The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton, the group\\'s first\\never endorsement for a presidential nominee and a rebuke of Republican Donald Trump in the middle of his party\\'s convention.\\n\\n The Trump campaign \"has gone from frankly something that was entertaining, comical, and has devolved into something that is frankly scary,\" said Javier Palomarez, the chamber president and chief executive officer.\\n He said the group weighed in because of Trump\\'s rhetoric, which has angered many in the U.S. minority community.\\n\\n Trump has been accused of bigotry for his hard line on immigration, and many of his comments have been blasted as racist ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.\\n\\n \"It wasn\\'t a step that was taken easily,\" Palomarez said, noting that many of the chamber\\'s board and members are \"staunch Republicans.\"\\n Trump kicked off his campaign last year saying Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers across the border, and he proposed building a wall to stop them.\\n He has called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants to shore up national security and suggested an Indiana\\nborn federal judge was unable to hear a lawsuit against his Trump University venture because the judge is of Mexican descent.\\n\\n The New York businessman\\'s positions have angered minority groups, liberals, Democrats, and even some Republicans, who have called them racist, divisive and callous.\\n Among black, Hispanic and Asian voters polled in the first 15 days of July, 70 percent supported Clinton while 9 percent supported Trump, according to a Reuters\\nIpsos opinion poll.\\n\\n Over that time, 45 percent of all likely voters supported Clinton and 34 percent supported Trump.\\n Trump became his party\\'s official nominee to the presidency on Tuesday at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.\\n Palomarez said the Clinton campaign earned their group\\'s endorsement by doing significant outreach to Latinos, including asking to speak with chamber members in different parts of the country.\\n \"I think she understands the challenges of American small businesses,\" he said.\\n\\n The convention had a dramatic start, as anti\\nTrump delegates tried, and failed, to force a roll\\ncall vote that would record the number of delegates opposed to the New York real estate developer.\\n The chamber is an organization of Hispanic business leaders representing the interests of Hispanic\\nowned businesses nationwide.\\n It had endorsed Clinton and

Twitter share button\\nBuena Vista Township Clerk Gloria Platko is resisting demands that she step down after another local official, Interim Township Manager Dexter Mitchell (a Democrat),\\xa0taped a phone conversation in which Platko referred to Township Supervisor Dwayne Parker (also a Democrat) as “an arrogant nigger.”\\n\\n The 63 year\\nold Democrat later apologized for the “slip of the tongue,” but shockingly insisted that her use of the slur doesn’t make her racist, because she has “eaten Thanksgiving dinner with black friends at their house.”\\nFrom MLive’s.\\n Bob Johnson:\\nMitchell said he recorded the call in January without Platko’s knowledge because he didn’t want her to twist his words.\\n About six minutes into the recording, Mitchell asks, “Would you be willing to sit down with (Parker)?”\\n\\n Platko told Mitchell that Parker is “just rubbing me the wrong way.\\n\\n “He is just doing whatever he can.\\n You know what I think of Mr. Parker right now, and I know you’re not even going to like this,” Platko said in the recording.\\n “But he’s just an arrogant (N\\nword).\\n And I’m sorry to say it that way, but that’s the way I feel.”\\n\\n Here’s the relevant portion of the conversation (you can hear the full recording here), which includes Mitchell asking Platko “Why would you say that?”, to which she replies “Because that’s what he’s proving to be, he’s just arrogant.”\\n It’s like being asked why you shot a guy, and responding “Duh!\\n Because I’m lousy with a knife!”:\\nWant to avoid video ads?\\n Subscribe to.\\n She told local NBC 25 reporter Walter Smith\\nRandolph that she was “sorry to my five other board members, and I’m entirely sorry to this entire community,” but added that “I’ve eaten Thanksgiving dinner with black friends at their house.\\n So I’m far from prejudiced.\\n You need to go interview some of the black people who have supported me for the last four or five years.”\\nSmith\\nRandolph did just that, but didn’t have much luck finding any Platko boosters.\\n\\n What’s Platko’s defense, that Dexter Mitchell’s tape recorder has Jedi powers?\\n (In case you’re wondering, according to current state law and judicial precedent, Mitchell’s taping of the conversation was legal.)\\n\\n “Yea, I probably should’ve used a word like ‘ignoramus’ or something like that, but I didn’t, and I’m sorry for the word I used,”.\\n Platko concluded.\\n Here’s the video, from NBC 25:\\nWant to avoid video ads?\\n Subscribe to.\\n There are two things worth noting in this story.\\n The first is that old racist attempt to recast slurs as something other than what they are.\\n We all probably have that one white acquaintance who has tried to push that “What?\\n A n*gger is an ignorant person, look in the dictionary!”\\n business on us, but as Wonkette‘s Jeff Wattrick points out, those definitions are rooted in the prejudice of the word.\\n When Gloria Platko poses “ignoramus” as a synonym for the n\\nword, she’s proving the point, not disproving it.\\n\\n The n\\nword meant “an ignorant person” in dictionaries of old because racists applied that characteristic to black people in their usage of the word, and the current application of the term to other races and nationalities is meant to convey that black people are inferior, hence the race or nationality in question is exceptionally inferior.\\n The flip side of this is the term “white trash,” which suggests that all other races are de facto trash, whereas the trash is the exception among whites.\\n I’m sorry, fellow white people, but there is no dictionary, no explanation, no Chris Rock routine that’s going to make it “okay” for you to use the n\\nword.\\n If you think you’re “down” because your black friends let you use it affectionately, you’re really not; they’re tolerating you, but you’re just annoying them.\\n\\n When I say “okay,” of course I’m not suggesting that people not be allowed to say it.\\n It’s a free country, and it would be nice to have these people out in the open, but if you say racist things, you are going to be judged accordingly.\\n And no, Don Young, “wetback” was never not an insult.\\n\\n The other important thing about this super\\nlocal story is that the offender was a Democrat.\\n I put it right there in the headline, which is a good thing, because none of the accounts I’ve read or watched include this important bit of information.\\n Yes, there are Democrats who are racist, or who say racially insensitive things.\\n Truth be told, sometimes the media lets them off a lot easier than they would a Republican, although that often has something to do with the degree of offense.\\n I’m not sure there’s a Democratic equivalent for the “Macaca” guy, George Allen, or a clearer message to minorities than responding to his disgrace by running him for U.S. Senate in 2012.\\n The difference is that when Democrats insult an entire race of people, Democrats still let them vote.\\n They fight for their right to vote them out.\\n They don’t complain about all the black people and minorities who are voting, they use a “machine” to encourage it.\\n You can argue all day about which party’s policies are actually more helpful to minorities, but only Democrats support allowing as many of them as possible to decide the question.\\n\\n Telling Michigan Residents to

accused of colluding with Iranian leaders to undermine Trump administration.\\n By.\\n Fox News.\\n Check out what\\'s clicking on Foxnews.com.\\n Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif claimed in recently leaked audio that John Kerry,\\xa0when he was serving as Secretary of State during the Obama administration,\\xa0informed him of more than 200 Israeli operations in Syria.\\n Kerry has previously been accused of colluding with Iranian leaders to undermine the Trump administration.\\n Kerry is now a part of the Biden administration and has a seat on the National Security Council as the special presidential envoy for climate.\\n Kerry shocked Zarif by revealing that Israel had attacked Iranian targets in Syria more than 200 times, according to leaked audio obtained by The New York Times\\xa0and other outlets.\\xa0\\n Zarif also\\xa0spoke frankly about his limited power compared to Ayatollah Ali Khameini and the blow the U.S. dealt to Iran by killing Gen.\\xa0Qassem Soleimani in January 2020.\\xa0\\n TOP DIPLOMAT, IN LEAKED RECORDING, OFFERS BLUNT COMMENTS ABOUT RUSSIA, SOLEIMANIKerry faced criticism on Monday over Zarif\\'s claim.\\n Kerry was ratting out Israeli covert operations in Syria directly to the Iranian foreign minister.\\n Let that sink in.\\n Wow,\" Noah Pollak of the foreign policy\\nfocused Democratic Alliance Group wrote on Twitter.\\n Former special advisor for Iran at the State Department Gabriel Noronha weighed in on Zarif\\'s lasting political career, despite his differences with others in Iranian governnment.\\n \"The main reason Zarif has survived as Foreign Minister for 8 years in Iran’s cutthroat political environment is that he serves as the ‘reasonable’ storefront to the world, protecting the more empowered radical elements of the regime from Western and press scrutiny,\" Noronha said in a statement..\\n Iran\\'s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif prepares to address the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, at United Nations headquarters, Wednesday, July 17, 2019.\\n \"Most of the time, Zarif’s Foreign Ministry is relegated to the job of the marketing and PR team, justifying and defending the policy choices of the IRGC and Supreme Leader Khamenei abroad,\" he continued.\\xa0\\n \"I think the leak was likely instigated by regime insiders who have long hated Zarif and tried to oust him —\\xa0they oppose current efforts to rejoin the JCPOA and also want to bolster domestic opposition to President Rouhani and his allies running for office in June.\\n release of the comments by\\xa0Zarif set off a firestorm within Iran, where officials carefully mind their words amid a cutthroat political environment that includes the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, ultimately overseen by the country\\'s supreme leader.\\n Zarif has been suggested as a possible candidate for Iran\\'s June 18 presidential election as well..\\n Outside of Iran, Zarif\\'s comments could also affect talks in Vienna aimed at finding a way for Tehran and the U.S. to both come into compliance with Iran\\'s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.\\n He told journalists on Monday that the recording represented just a portion of a seven\\nhour interview Zarif gave to a well\\nknown economist that was to be held for posterity by a think tank associated with the Iranian presidency.\\n Zarif, visiting Iraq on Monday after a trip to Qatar, took no questions from journalists after giving a brief statement in Baghdad.\\n Fox News\\' inquiry to the State Department was not returned at

Check.\\n Did John Lennon Say \\'Ringo Wasn\\'t Even the Best Drummer in the Beatles\\'?\\n\\n This was one of the more famous quotes about a Beatle..David Mikkelson.\\n Published Oct 30, 2019\\n7th July 1964:.British drummer Ringo Starr of The Beatles in London on his 24th birthday..\\n Powered By.10.Yes.the Direction of a Ceiling Fan s Rotation Matters in Summer vs.WinterShareNextStay.\\n Claim:.John Lennon once asserted that Ringo Starr \"wasn\\'t even the best drummer in the Beatles.\".\\n Rating:.Misattributed.\\n About this rating.\\n During the height of Beatlemania in the mid\\n1960s, debates about the virtues of individual members of the Fab Four tended to take place among their young female fans, who focused on questions such which Beatle was the cutest, the funniest, or would make the best husband.\\n\\n As the Beatles made the transition from teenage idols to pop music legends, debates about the individual members shifted to more substantive matters, such as pondering which one was the best singer or best songwriter or best instrumentalist.\\n\\n https:\\nyoutu.be\\nb5rpAqfd35Q\\nIn the \"best instrumentalist\" category, arguments over Ringo Starr\\'s drumming prowess were often polarized between two camps: those who believed Ringo to be one of the best rock drummers ever, and those who viewed him as an ordinary talent (at best) who lucked out in being tapped to join a group of three vastly superior musicians.\\n Proponents of the latter viewpoint often cited a purported quote from John Lennon himself in which Lennon supposedly scoffed at the notion of Ringo as the best drummer of all time, quipping: \"The best drummer in the world?\\n Ringo wasn’t even the best drummer in the Beatles!\\n \"\\nIt\\'s unlikely Lennon would ever have said such a thing and meant it seriously, as he — along with the other Beatles — typically spoke fondly and positively of Ringo, both as a person and as a drummer.\\n In the famous Playboy interview conducted just a few months before his murder in 1980, for example, Lennon responded as follows when asked for his opinion of Ringo\\'s musicianship:Advertisement:\\nPLAYBOY: \"Let\\'s move on to Ringo.\\n What\\'s your opinion of him musically?\"\\nLENNON:\\n \"Ringo was a star in his own right in Liverpool before we even met.\\n He was a professional drummer who sang and performed and had Ringo Starr\\ntime, and he was in one of the top groups in Britain but especially in Liverpool before we even had a drummer.\\n So Ringo\\'s talent would have come out one way or the other as something or other.\\n I don\\'t know what he would have ended up as, but whatever that spark is in Ringo that we all know but can\\'t put our finger on ... whether it is acting, drumming or singing, I don\\'t know ...\\n there is something in him that is projectable and he would have surfaced with or without the Beatles.\\n Ringo is a damn good drummer.\\n He is not technically good, but I think Ringo\\'s drumming is underrated the same way Paul\\'s bass playing is underrated ...\\n I think Paul and Ringo stand up with any of the rock musicians.\\n\\n Those who have tried to run the alleged criticism of Lennon\\'s to ground have found it to be sourceless, something that has not turned up in any known audio recording, interview transcript, or primary reporting on Lennon and the Beatles, as renowned Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn noted in an interview with the Los Angeles Times:\\nAs part of his in\\ndepth research, Lewisohn also has debunked a humorous knock on Starr’s drumming abilities, long attributed to John Lennon.\\n For decades, people and media outlets have repeated the anecdote about Lennon being asked whether he considered Starr to be the best drummer in the world.\\n The oft\\nquoted response: “He’s not even the best drummer in the Beatles.”\\nWhile it sounds like the kind of acerbic comment that might have come out of Lennon’s mouth, Lewisohn says no.\\n\\n “The London Times newspaper quoted John Lennon ‘famously saying that Ringo wasn’t even the best drummer in the Beatles.’\\n John Lennon never said that, famously or otherwise, and that is the London Times quoting him,” Lewisohn said, making a point about his motivation for trying to separate fact from Fab Four mythology.\\n\\n he said.\\n “I determined to get to the bottom of it ...\\n John Lennon never said it \\n and wouldn’t have said it.”\\n\\n Those who have sought the true origins of this quip have commonly attributed it to a 1983 television appearance by British comedian Jasper Carrott.\\n Covers the page.\\n Report ad\\nThank you for letting us know.\\n\\n\\n .FDA denies being ordered by Trump administration to only display Fox News on TVs.\\n

to CNN that \"it is certainly not White House policy\" to mandate television sets in the FDA be tuned into Fox News.\\n Sanders said she was unaware of any such directive being issued from the White House..\\n In an email sent to a listserv on Wednesday to employees at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, a research center at the FDA, a representative for the agency\\'s Office of Facilities said, \"The current administration ... has requested that all monitors, under our control, on the White Oak Campus, display Fox News.\".\\n \"Sorry for the inconvenience, but I am unable to change any of the monitors to any other news source at this time,\" wrote the representative, Christopher Stumphy.\\n He did not respond to a request for comment..\\n A spokesperson for the FDA declined to say why the email was sent out from the Office of Facilities..Related: Fox News fight moves to U.K..\\n The message from Stumphy, however, appeared to have been prompted by an email sent on Tuesday to the same listserv, which is made up of scientists and researchers within the FDA..\\n In that email, obtained by CNN, a supervisory medical officer wrote to colleagues about how he found it \"particularly odious to be confronted with Fox News telecasts\" at the scientific facility and floated the idea of a protest against the move..\\n The email generated dozens of responses, a person familiar with the exchange said.\\n One person who responded wrote that Fox News, the cable news network that generally provides the most favorable coverage to President Trump and his administration, was \"inappropriate\" and \"unacceptable\" because of its \"political bias.\".\\n A big winner in Trump\\'s first 100 days?\\n The White Oak campus is a large FDA facility which houses several large

22, 2017.\\n \\n Tom Tillison.\\n.Print\\n Article.\\n Share Tweet Truth.\\n Gettr Parler Telegram LinkedIn.\\n Marus Lemonis, the CEO of Camping World, learned how quickly things can blow up on social media after he weighed in on events in Charlottesville.\\n\\n Appearing on CNBC, Lemonis was asked to comment on corporate leaders stepping down from White House business councils over President Donald Trump’s remarks on the violence last weekend — for the record, Lemonis is no fan of Trump’s.\\n\\n “There’s no doubt that there is probably not many consumers in this country today that are in favor of what has been said in the last couple days — and if they are, frankly, don’t shop at my business,” Lemonis said.\\n\\n Camping World is the title sponsor of NASCAR’s truck racing series, and the comment prompted media reports claiming Lemonis told race fans who support Trump to shop elsewhere.\\n\\n Things got even more heated when popular retired NASCAR driver Mark Martin took to Twitter to say: “First thing in the morning I will be cancelling my order for 150,000$ RV I have ordered.\\n Leave politics out of it.”.\\n Martin would later delete the tweet after speaking with Lemonis, saying he regretted posting it.\\n\\n “After a call from\\xa0@marcuslemonis\\xa0today regret my tweet yesterday.\\n I believe many articles about his statement were misrepresented,” he tweeted.\\n\\n The former driver then echoed a sentiment many Americans agree with, that he is “sick of the fighting in our country.”\\nhttps:\\ntwitter.com\\nmarkmartin\\nstatus\\n899689890929156096\\nAs for Lemonis, he\\xa0decided to eliminate any go between and personally address the controversy in a video he posted on Twitter.\\n\\n Steering the focus away from Trump.\\n he said that\\xa0in addition to the right to free speech, we have “a responsibility to respect each another,” and moved to clarify his earlier remarks.\\n\\n “For the record, I am against hatred and I am against violence, from anybody,” Lemonis said.\\n\\n Juan Williams disgusts his co\\nhosts after he badmouths the military; sick rant shows true colors\\n“I’m quite frankly very sad and scared, living in this country were we are so aggressive with each other that it’s taken out the spirit of what this country stands for,” he added.\\n\\n But Lemonis was adamant that he will not say hatred and violence is OK and will take the heat, if necessary.\\n\\n “I’ll continue to take the damaging tweets, I’ll continue to take the damaging Facebook posts, I continue to take the death threats,” he said.\\n\\n If you are fed up with letting radical big tech execs, phony fact\\ncheckers, tyrannical liberals and a lying mainstream media

for:\\nThe political psychology behind Trump’s bizarre handshakes\\nReddit\\nPocket\\nFlipboard\\nEmail\\nZack Beauchamp.is a senior correspondent at Vox, where he covers ideology and challenges to democracy, both at home and abroad.\\n President Donald Trump’s meetings with world leaders are, at this point, the stuff of awkward legend.\\n Trump seems to be trying so hard to establish dominance in these interactions that things invariably get weird and uncomfortable.\\n\\n Here he is aggressively shaking hands with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (the whole thing lasted for a very long 19 seconds):\\n(Yosub Kim\\nGIPHY)\\n\\n He’s had two deeply uncomfortable handshakes with French President Emmanuel Macron:\\n(Bloomberg via GIPHY)\\n(Live Satellite News)\\nAnd Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made sure to stand his ground during an aggressive Trumpshake at the White House:\\n(GIPHY)\\nThe best non\\nhandshake example of Trump’s need to dominate foreign leaders comes from a NATO summit that took place back in May — when the president literally shoved the prime minister of Montenegro out of the way to get to the front of a group photo.\\n Note the little buttoning\\nup of the jacket at the end:\\n(NBC News)\\n\\n When Huerta refused, Wilson literally invaded Mexico.\\n But why?\\n Why does this kind of petty maneuvering seem to matter so much?\\nTo find out, I asked an expert: Jonathan Renshon, a professor of international relations at the University of Wisconsin Madison.\\n Renshon thinks Trump’s weird handshakes and attention seeking are just a crude manifestation of a kind of behavior that most world leaders exhibit.\\n Caring about this kind of thing, he tells me, is part of how they became successful politicians in the first place.\\n But now that they’re running a country, their shenanigans are a lot higher profile — as are the stakes.\\n\\n “Where a person is stationed in a photograph ... is connected to notions of who’s in charge, who people defer to,” Renshon tells me.\\n “And there’s lots of evidence this stuff matters on an interpersonal, and now on a state, level.”\\nStatus diplomacy meets Trump diplomacy\\nPsychologists have been looking at the way humans think about status for a long time.\\n Perhaps the most enduring and well\\nestablished finding, according to Renshon, is that status really matters: People who are perceived to be more important and influential, more respected by others or higher in their social hierarchy, get all sorts of benefits.\\n\\n “High status individuals benefit in real economic terms from the deference (i.e., preferential treatment) shown to them by lower\\nranked individuals,” he writes in the book.\\n “Status positions even affect how we see the world.\\n For example, high\\nstatus individuals hear louder applause for themselves and use different language when they speak.”\\nWhile most people are acutely aware of these power dynamics — lab experiments Renshon cites in his book have found that even infants can figure out which adults are high\\nstatus — there are some people who care so much about their status that they are willing to fight to establish dominance.\\n Donald Trump is, by his own account, one of those people: The common thread in all 12 of his books is an obsession with his status, of showing that he’s better off than the people he’s competing with.\\n\\n \"You hear lots of people say that a great deal is when both sides win.\\n That is a bunch of crap,” he writes in Think Big and Kick Ass (co\\nauthored with Bill Zanker).\\n \"In a great deal you win — not the other side.\\n You crush the opponent and come away with something better for yourself ... to crush the other side and take the benefits [is] better than sex — and I love sex.\\n \"\\nThis attitude is pretty common among people with political authority.\\n He found that those people — people who chose to go into public service and politics — tend to be extremely attuned to status in his experiments.\\n\\n The higher you go up the political food chain, the more likely this is to be true.\\n Prime ministers, presidents, and the like regularly have to navigate situations where attention to and concern for status is a very important trait to have.\\n\\n That makes top\\nlevel diplomacy, to a certain extent, an exercise in corralling people with giant egos.\\n Sometimes, as Renshon documents in the book, this leads to absurd fights and petty arguments — even among some of the most important figures in history.\\n\\n “At the Potsdam conference in 1945, the leaders of the three great powers of the day — Harry Truman, Winston Churchill, and Josef Stalin — could not agree on the order they’d enter the conference room,” he writes.\\n “It was eventually decided that all three should enter simultaneously through separate doors.”\\n\\n This is part of why Trump’s interactions with foreign heads of state and other leaders are so awkward.\\n It’s not just that Trump is especially obsessed with being perceived as dominant — though he is.\\n It’s that he’s dealing with other people who are acutely sensitive to status, and so care a lot about how they look in interactions with the US president..\\n Think about that when you look at this GIF of Trump snubbing German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s request for a handshake (which also adds a gendered dynamic):\\n(Giphy)\\nOr how Tajik President Emomali Rahmon pulls Trump into his handshake, rather than allowing Trump to pull him forward:\\n(GIPHY)\\n\\n In these two cases, and the above ones, they’re especially brutal because of the pained reactions these foreign leaders are having to Trump.\\n Clearly, they’re put off by someone so obviously playing games about this stuff in public and feel like they have to react in some way while the camera is on them..\\n This all seems so weird because the rituals of how foreign leaders meet and greet one another in public tend to be worked out in advance by aides, like it was at Potsdam, in order to avoid potential embarrassments.\\n But Trump doesn’t know diplomatic niceties and doesn’t follow any script.\\n He does what makes sense to him in the moment, including weird handshakes and other shows of dominance that date back at least to his days as a real estate mogul.\\n\\n What we’re seeing now is foreign leaders trying to deal with the sort of issue that’s normally worked out behind closed doors happening in front of cameras, with no warning and a president who can’t really be counted on to react predictably.\\n It’s no surprise that their own need for their status to be respected kicks in, and they react negatively or aggressively to Trump’s provocations — yielding the GIFs we all know and love.\\n\\n Will you support Vox’s

documents (proprietary hardware\\nsoftware manuals from Microchip Technology Inc.).\\n The project was maintained between 2014 and 2015.\\n\\n Protego is not the \"usual\" malware development project like all previous publications by WikiLeaks in the Vault7 series.\\n Indeed there is no explicit indication why it is part of the project repositories of the CIA\\nEDG at all.\\n\\n The Protego project is a PIC\\nbased missile control system that was developed by Raytheon.\\n The documents indicate that the system is installed on\\nboard a Pratt & Whitney aircraft (PWA) equipped with missile launch systems (air\\nto\\nair and\\nor air\\nto\\nground).\\n\\n Protego consists of separate micro\\ncontroller units that exchange data and signals over encrypted and authenticated channels:.»\\n On\\nboard TWA are the \\'Master Processor\\' (MP) and the \\'Deployment Box\\'.\\n Both systems are layed\\nout with master\\nslave redundancy..»\\n The missle system has micro\\ncontrollers for the missle itself (\\'Missle Smart Switch\\', MSS), the tube (\\'Tube Smart Switch\\', TSS) and the collar (which holds the missile before and at launch time).\\n\\n The MP unit receives three signals

and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\\n\\n The OTS (Office of Technical Services), a branch within the CIA, has a biometric collection system that is provided to liaison services around the world \\n with the expectation for sharing of the biometric takes collected on the systems.\\n But this \\'voluntary sharing\\' obviously does not work or is considered insufficient by the CIA, because ExpressLane is a covert information collection tool that is used by the CIA to secretly exfiltrate data collections from such systems provided to liaison services.\\n\\n ExpressLane is installed and run with the cover of upgrading the biometric software by OTS agents that visit the liaison sites.\\n Liaison officers overseeing this procedure will remain unsuspicious, as the data exfiltration disguises behind a Windows installation splash screen.\\n\\n The core components of the OTS system are based on products from Cross Match, a US company specializing in biometric software for law enforcement and the Intelligence Community.\\n The company hit the headlines in 2011 when it was reported that the US military used a Cross Match product to identify Osama bin Laden during the

concealed from an user or even system administrator.\\n\\n The installation and persistence method of the malware is not described in detail in the document; an operator will have to rely on the available CIA exploits and backdoors to inject the kernel module into a target operating system.\\n OutlawCountry v1.0 contains one kernel module for 64\\nbit CentOS\\nRHEL 6.x; this module will only

running the Micorosoft Windows operating system.\\n Once persistently installed on a target machine using separate CIA exploits, the malware scans visible WiFi access points and records the ESS identifier, MAC address and signal strength at regular intervals.\\n To perform the data collection the target machine does not have to be online or connected to an access point; it only needs to be running with an enabled WiFi device.\\n If it is connected to the internet, the malware automatically tries to use public geo\\nlocation databases from Google or Microsoft to resolve the position of the device and stores the longitude and latitude data along with the timestamp.\\n The collected access point\\ngeo\\nlocation information is stored in encrypted form on the device for later exfiltration.\\n The malware itself does not beacon this data to a CIA back\\nend; instead the operator must actively retrieve the log file from the device \\n again using separate CIA exploits and backdoors.\\n\\n The ELSA project allows the customization of the implant to match the target environment and operational objectives like sampling interval, maximum size of the logfile and invocation\\npersistence method..\\n Additional back\\nend software (again using public geo\\nlocation databases from Google and Microsoft) converts unprocessed access point information from exfiltrated logfiles to geo\\nlocation data to create a tracking profile of the target device.\\n\\n Leaked Documents.\\n ELSA User Manual\\nBrutal Kangaroo.22 June, 2017\\n\\n Today, June 22nd 2017, WikiLeaks publishes documents from the Brutal Kangaroo project of the CIA.\\n Brutal Kangaroo is a tool suite for Microsoft Windows that targets closed networks by air gap jumping using thumbdrives.\\n Brutal Kangaroo components create a custom covert network within the target closed network and providing functionality for executing surveys, directory listings, and arbitrary executables.\\n\\n The documents describe how a CIA operation can infiltrate a closed network (or a single air\\ngapped computer) within an organization or enterprise without direct access.\\n It first infects a Internet\\nconnected computer within the organization (referred to as \"primary host\").and installs the BrutalKangeroo malware on it.\\n When a user is using the primary host and inserts a USB stick into it, the thumbdrive itself is infected with a separate malware.\\n If this thumbdrive is used to copy data between the closed network and the LAN\\nWAN, the user will sooner or later plug the USB disk into a computer on the closed network.\\n By browsing the USB drive with Windows Explorer on such a protected computer, it also gets infected with exfiltration\\nsurvey malware.\\n If multiple computers on the closed network are under CIA control, they form a covert network to coordinate tasks and data exchange.\\n Although not explicitly stated in the documents, this method of compromising closed networks is very similar to how Stuxnet worked.\\n\\n The Brutal Kangaroo project consists of the following components: Drifting Deadline is the thumbdrive infection tool, Shattered Assurance is a server tool that handles automated infection of thumbdrives (as the primary mode of propagation for the Brutal Kangaroo suite), Broken Promise is the Brutal Kangaroo postprocessor (to evaluate collected information) and Shadow is the primary persistence mechanism (a stage 2 tool that is distributed across a closed network and acts as a covert command\\nand\\ncontrol network; once multiple Shadow instances are installed and share drives, tasking and payloads can be sent back\\nand\\nforth).\\n\\n The primary execution vector used by infected thumbdrives is a vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows operating system that can be exploited by hand\\ncrafted link files that load and execute programs (DLLs) without user interaction.\\n Older versions of the tool suite used a mechanism called EZCheese that was a 0\\nday exploit until March 2015; newer versions seem use a similar, but yet unknown link file vulnerability (Lachesis\\nRiverJack) related to the library\\nms functionality of the operating system.\\n\\n Leaked Documents.\\n Brutal Kangaroo \\n Drifting Deadline v1.2 \\n User Guide.\\n EzCheese v6.3 \\n

implemented with the help of the US nonprofit Stanford Research Institute (SRI International).\\n\\n CherryBlossom provides a means of monitoring the Internet activity of and performing software exploits on Targets of interest.\\n In particular, CherryBlossom is focused on compromising wireless networking devices, such as wireless routers and access points (APs), to achieve these goals.\\n Such Wi\\nFi devices are commonly used as part of the Internet infrastructure in private homes, public spaces (bars, hotels or airports), small and medium sized companies as well as enterprise offices.\\n Therefore these devices are the ideal spot for \"Man\\nIn\\nThe\\nMiddle\" attacks, as they can easily monitor, control and manipulate the Internet traffic of connected users.\\n By altering the data stream between the user and Internet services, the infected device can inject malicious content into the stream to exploit vulnerabilities in applications or the operating system on the computer of the targeted user.\\n\\n The wireless device itself is compromized by implanting a customized CherryBlossom firmware on it; some devices allow upgrading their firmware over a wireless link, so no physical access to the device is necessary for a successful infection.\\n Once the new firmware on the device is flashed, the router or access point will become a so\\ncalled FlyTrap.\\n A FlyTrap will beacon over the Internet to a Command & Control server referred to as the CherryTree.\\n In response to this information, the CherryTree sends a Mission with operator\\ndefined tasking.\\n An operator can use CherryWeb, a browser\\nbased user interface to view Flytrap status and security info, plan Mission tasking, view Mission\\nrelated data, and perform system administration tasks.\\n\\n Missions may include tasking on Targets to monitor, actions\\nexploits to perform on a Target, and instructions on when and how to send the next beacon.\\n Tasks for a Flytrap include (among others) the scan for email addresses, chat usernames, MAC addresses and VoIP numbers in passing network traffic to trigger additional actions, the copying of the full network traffic of a Target,.the redirection of a Target’s browser (e.g., to Windex for browser exploitation) or the proxying of a Target’s network connections.\\n FlyTrap can also setup VPN tunnels to a CherryBlossom\\nowned VPN server to give an operator access to clients on the Flytrap’s.\\n WLAN\\nLAN for further exploitation.\\n When the Flytrap detects a Target, it will send an Alert to the CherryTree and commence any actions\\nexploits against the Target.\\n Leaked Documents.\\n CherryBlossom \\n System Req Spec (CDRL\\n10).CherryBlossom \\n Quick Start Guide.\\n WiFi Devices.\\n

on target computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system (from Windows XP to Windows 10)..Once installed, the malware provides a beaconing capability (including configuration and task handling), the memory loading\\nunloading of malicious payloads for specific tasks and the delivery and retrieval of files to\\nfrom a specified directory on the target system.\\n It allows the operator to configure settings during runtime (while the implant is on target) to customize it to an operation.\\n\\n According to the documentation (see Athena Technology Overview), the malware was developed by the CIA in cooperation with Siege Technologies, a self\\nproclaimed cyber security company based in New Hampshire, US.\\n On their website, Siege Technologies states that the company \"... focuses on leveraging offensive cyberwar technologies and methodologies to develop predictive cyber security solutions for insurance, government and other targeted markets.\".\\n On November 15th, 2016 Nehemiah Security announced the acquisition of Siege Technologies.\\n\\n In an email from HackingTeam (published by WikiLeaks here), Jason Syversen, founder of Siege Technologies with a

language which allows operators to schedule custom tasks to be executed on the target machine.\\n\\n \"Assassin\".is a similar kind of malware; it is an automated implant that provides a simple collection platform on remote computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system.\\n Once the tool is installed on the target, the implant is run within a Windows service process.\\n It allows the re\\ndirecting of traffic from the target computer inside the LAN through a computer infected with this malware and controlled by the CIA.\\n This technique is used by the CIA to redirect the

Bzdak\\nChicago Tribune\\nTNS via Getty\\nAndrew Prokop.is a senior politics correspondent at Vox, covering the White House, elections, and political scandals and investigations.\\n He’s worked at Vox since the site’s launch in 2014, and before that, he worked as a research assistant at the New Yorker’s Washington, DC, bureau.\\n\\n President Obama participated in a venerable tradition Tuesday night by using his farewell address to give warnings about his fears for America’s future.\\n\\n While the speech was broadly optimistic in tone and avoided any significant discussion of the man who will soon occupy the White House, the bulk of the text was devoted to expressing his fears about how things could go wrong for the United States.\\n\\n The president named five specific threats he said he felt American democracy was currently facing: economic inequality, racial tensions, polarization, foreign threats, and decaying democratic institutions..“How we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids, and create good jobs, and protect our homeland,” Obama said.\\n\\n Most farewell addresses are forgettable.\\n Indeed, the first and most famous presidential farewell address, delivered by Washington, was framed as a series of explicit warnings to the young nation from “a parting friend.”\\n Racial tensions.\\n Polarization and closed\\nmindedness.\\n “ISIL will try to kill innocent people..\\n He continued:\\nOur Constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift..\\n The elephant in the room: Donald Trump\\n\\n At a moment when many Democrats and liberals are intensely concerned about what the next administration could bring, Obama mostly avoided the topic, except perhaps in the broadest strokes..\\n Indeed, aside from a brief mention near the beginning, in which Obama again reiterated his commitment to ensuring “the smoothest possible transition” for Trump, the president\\nelect and the specifics of the controversial campaign he waged went unmentioned.\\nObama clearly feels a farewell address is not the place for a president to launch a bombastic criticism of his successor.\\n But Obama thinks quite a lot about his place in history, and how his various actions will be viewed in the very long term.\\n He seems to have been writing not for the concerns of the present moment, but for the concerns he felt American democracy will still face 10 and 20 years from now..Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?.Millions turn to Vox to educate themselves, their family, and their friends about what’s

alternative media sources of news and analysis, 21WIRE is running its own #FakeNewsWeek\\xa0awareness campaign, where each day our\\xa0editorial team at 21st Century Wire will feature media critiques and analysis of mainstream corporate media coverage of current events – exposing the government and the mainstream media as the real purveyors of ‘fake news’ throughout modern history…\\nHow the Media’s Fake News Narrative Sustains “Bad\\nVlad’ Meme\\n.\\n\\n Mark Anderson21st Century WireThe U.S. government, the ‘intelligence’ community and their malicious mainstream\\nmedia partners in deception just won’t let it go.\\n\\n The underhanded U.S. unitary state, which seeks a unipolar world with the U.S. in charge, still says in its “never ending story” that omniscient, omnipresent Russian leader Vladimir Putin masterminded hacking the computerized systems of U.S. elections as well as Democratic National Committee computers.\\n\\n Then, as the stale tale goes, Russia handed all the resulting electronic juicy tidbits over to Wikileaks, which turned around and dropped a veritable information bomb on America’s delicate democracy.\\n\\n But while that “bomb” allegedly influenced enough people to vote for the winner Donald Trump and not for loser Hillary Clinton, to this day, according to big media, we’re supposed to forget all about the creepy, damning, criminally inclined things contained in the Podesta\\nClinton emails themselves.\\n\\n So, let’s try and grasp this media\\nmassaged, intel\\ninfused message: Even though the emails apparently had enough sizzle and scandal to boost one presidential candidate over another, we’re still prodded to think that the information in the emails somehow isn’t the issue—even though the content\\xa0of the emails will always\\xa0be what matters the most.\\n\\n Also notice what no one, and certainly no media outlet, dares to mention regarding the other half of this issue: If Putin also was crafty enough to hack into the actual state\\nlevel U.S. election systems, then this implies\\xa0that U.S. elections systems can be hacked in the first place.\\n\\n This is huge.\\n Think about it the next time you use an electronic “ES&S Ivotronic”\\xa0touchscreen voting machine or\\xa0Hart InterCivic’s model at the polls.\\n\\n All along, we’ve been reassured that the electronic voting systems used in about 95% of American voting precincts are The Greatest Thing Ever Invented and Monumentally Secure…\\nAre they really?THE ELECTORAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX: Securing America’s automated voting systems has become a complicated affair..\\n And, all along, writers like Yours Truly, highly credible Texas vote\\nreform activists like Laura Pressley, Vickie Karp, Bev Harris and others have uncovered tons of evidence that electronic elections are an immensely deceptive and vulnerable apparatus — vulnerable to external hacking and also to being “fixed” from the inside without any need for outside hacking, through the proprietary software inside the these voting contraptions that can be pre\\nset to steal elections if the need arises.\\n\\n You’re going to want to see my interview with Laura Pressley, on behalf of American Free Press, through this link right here.\\n Pressley shows in detail, the\\xa0integrity and lawfulness of Texas elections are in serious peril — not because of any outside “autocrats” like Putin and his supposed cyberspace minions, but because of state and local election officials, right here in the U.S., who absolutely will not follow state election law.\\n And the average TV or newspaper reporter is utterly tone\\ndeaf to these problems, which keeps the people in perpetual fog, unaware that U.S. elections have been effectively privatized by those who make the machines that count the votes.\\n\\n To hear more about this “Putin the Hacker” debacle, please listen to my Dec. 29, 2016 interview with UK\\nbased radio host Andrew Carrington Hitchcock on his regularly scheduled American Free Press (AFP) show.\\n\\n Furthermore, check out this Election Night Gatekeepers overview on my blog by election\\ntheft expert Jim Condit Jr., who worked with the late Collier brothers in their game\\nchanging book, “Votescam.”.\\n The media is part of a secretive consortium that counts the vote in secret, meaning the mainstream press’ fake news carries with it evidence of criminal collusion.\\n\\n The unavoidable conclusion is that the powers\\nthat\\nbe — in going after Putin and calling him The Supreme Hacker of the Known Universe\\xa0— have shot themselves in the foot because they’re clearly and finally admitting in the process that U.S. voting systems CAN be hacked, after more than a decade of denial.\\n\\n This means that all their denials about electronic election fraud are invalidated..\\n The establishment is wrong.\\n End of discussion.\\n\\n Meanwhile, recalling some recent history, Wayne Madsen Reports provided\\xa0some important perspective:“Although the Central Intelligence Agency has had a long history of undermining presidents\\nelect and prime ministers\\nelect in other countries, the United States has never witnessed the intelligence agency so blatantly attempting to politically weaken a U.S. president\\nelect\\n [Trump] just a few weeks prior to the inauguration.\\n What the CIA is doing in forcing Donald Trump into shifting from his campaign promise of restoring good relations with Russia to one of outright hostility to Moscow — favored by the CIA, Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the neo\\nconservatives within the Republican and Democratic Party establishments— is nothing less than an overt threat to American democracy.”WHERE\\n And, as American Free Press reported in its first 2017 edition, the young owner of a Russian\\nbased web\\nserver company may have a handle on who stole sensitive electronic communications between Hillary Clinton and some of her advisors.\\n\\n But 26\\nyear\\nold Vladimir Fomenko knows one thing for sure: U.S. intelligence, which professes to be hot on the trail of exposing Russian hacking, doesn’t seem to care about his story.\\n\\n This means that our leaders in Washington have long ignored a solid lead that could prove once and for all whether or not the Russian government hacked the computers systems of top Democrats and U.S. elections systems.\\n\\n Fomenko recently spoke to AFP to try and demystify the controversy surrounding his King Servers company and the cyberattacks purportedly carried out at the behest of Russia.\\n\\n AFP writer John Friend, quoting Fomenko, noted that even though his servers were exploited in this cyber\\ncrime: “No U.S. law enforcement or intelligence agency is interested in speaking with him to gather real evidence on the perpetrators.”\\nThe U.S. was not the only country hit by computer hackers.\\n Hackers evidently targeted Germany, Turkey, and Ukraine, apparently attempting to upset democratic processes.\\n\\n It was when WikiLeaks began releasing hacked data from the DNC late this past summer that media reports and the Clinton campaign began blaming Russia with no solid evidence to support that assertion.\\n\\n After learning about this shadowy criminal activity, Fomenko immediately shut down the servers and looked into the situation.\\n He says he’s willing to cooperate with law enforcement.\\n\\n “We pursued an investigation without delay and found some tracks leading to Europe,” Fomenko told AFP.\\n\\n “Web hosting is a legal enterprise.. . .\\n regulated by law,” Fomenko added.\\n “King Servers works in Russia, the U.S., and the Netherlands and complies with the laws of these countries.”\\nFomenko stressed: “No U.S. law enforcement agency has contacted us at this time.\\n Neither the FBI nor any other U.S., Russian, or Dutch intelligence agency has contacted us.\\n ”The plot thickens…\\xa0WSB\\nTV Channel 2 reporters in Atlanta, Georgia actually did their job and noted: “The Georgia Secretary of State’s office now confirms 10 different cyberattacks on its network all trace back to U.S. Department of Homeland Security IP addresses.”\\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, dissatisfied with the federal government’s dodgy explanation about these DHS cyberattacks, fired off a letter to then\\nPresident\\nelect Donald Trump to put him in the loop.\\n\\n So, it’ll be interesting to see if Trump ever helps Georgia, and other states whose election systems were supposedly hacked, figure out what happened and who’s really responsible.\\n\\n After all this time, the accusation that Russia “did it” still looks less and less credible, as this additional AFP piece outlines,\\xa0yet the American establishment, thinking it could blame Russia to explain Hillary’s loss and come to grips with Trump’s win, just won’t drop the blame\\nPutin narrative.\\n\\n We can only hope that Trump’s claim that he’ll start putting some limits on our out\\nof\\ncontrol spy agencies will come true.\\n If ever there was a good reason to pursue those limits, this high\\nlevel U.S. intelligence gambit to blame Putin, no matter what, is it.\\n The orthodox press has been a solid ally all along of these intel\\nintrigues.\\n\\n And this gives Trump a chance to prove he’s the real deal, and not another asset of the establishment, despite his seemingly honest intentions to name names and seek real solutions to the real problems that are troubling Americans and citizens across the world.\\n For, if elections are not really a means to find and assign better leaders who will use their victory as a mandate to do the right thing for the voters,\\xa0then what’s the point of having elections at all, hacked or not hacked, honest or not?Author

that the identity politics that many students are being taught in schools could tear apart what our Founders established in making many, one..\\n During my last year in high school, all seniors were required to write a speech about the topic of their choice and present this speech to the student body and faculty.\\n My essay, titled “Division”, dealt with how identity politics ruined the last few years at the high school that I attended.\\n It was summarized well here.\\n\\n In the weeks following the presentation of my speech, I remember being asked what led me to choose the topic, a topic of which could very likely lead to ridicule and even hostility from those listening..\\n What defining moments compelled me to challenge the way in which I was being taught?\\n Also, did I receive any backlash from my essay?\\n\\n I had been raised in a conservative household, with a father who was especially staunch in his conservative beliefs.\\n It was often pointed out, while watching the news, and reading articles, the obvious slant towards the Left.\\n Because of this, it was easy to recognize when topics were being presented in school that were favorable towards the beliefs of the Left.\\n A few examples stood out clearly.\\n\\n During my sophomore year of high school, a mandatory lesson for the entire school was scheduled regarding the concept of being an ally towards those who were labeled as being marginalized.\\n All homeroom teachers were required to discuss the idea that “privileged” people need to stand up for the minority students and ensure their safety and well\\nbeing.\\n Minority students included anyone that was not white, straight, and Christian.\\n The absurdity is how, within an instant, we were all separated into groups that we had not recognized prior to this.\\n Some were labeled as victims while others had a superior position just by being born.\\n From then on, relationships changed.\\n It was so insulting to suggest that one group of people should feel guilty for their “privilege” and the other group forced to have the mindset that they need help from the privileged.\\n\\n That was not the only time that the privilege concept was forced upon us.\\n Picture being called to an obligatory assembly.\\n You did not know the subject matter prior to attending.\\n As you sit down in your seat, you notice there is a panel of guests sitting on the stage.\\n The lights go down and the topic of the assembly is introduced.\\n The theme is now specifically “white privilege.”\\n Over the next 45 minutes, my white classmates and I learned that what we had accomplished throughout our short lives was tainted because of the “fortunate” color of our skin.\\n According to the speakers, we were hurting those around us without even knowing it.\\n It was now our responsibility to rectify that.\\n Never had I viewed people in this way.\\n That the color of our skin really separated us this much.\\n The administrators knew that they had a captive audience and used that opportunity to their advantage.\\n They presented this topic as fact.\\n I am glad that before this assembly, I never considered that I was greater than anyone due to the color of my skin.\\n It sickened me that anyone would believe that the color of my skin puts me on a greater level than others.\\n\\n As mentioned in the speech, on the first day of senior year, each student in every class was required to introduce themselves with their name and their preferred gender pronouns.\\n An issue was created over a problem that never existed.\\n It would have been frowned upon for not taking part in this charade.\\n Again, the administration knew that they had power over us, and they foisted their agenda with the knowledge that there would be no repercussions.\\n\\n These specific events, along with many others, tipped me over the edge.\\n I understood that nobody, parents nor students, no matter how furious they were, was going to do anything to challenge the indoctrination.\\n I was granted the perfect opportunity through the senior speech project, and I utilized it.\\n\\n After presenting my speech to the school and faculty, there was some minor blowback, which was expected.\\n Immediately following the speech, a student walked up to me and said, “F… you,” along with other vulgar language.\\n At the time, those around me and I laughed it off.\\n It never occurred to me to report this to an administrator, as some students suggested.\\n If that was her opinion on my speech, so be it.\\n Yet, I was very aware that the response most likely would have been very different if I had retorted so crudely to a speech written by her that didn’t fit what I believed.\\n My head spins with the thought of how quickly I would have been taken to the woodshed for tampering with her delicate sensibilities.\\n\\n In my class following the speech, it was good to hear that I had done well from one of my teachers.\\n Even though it is unlikely that she agreed with anything that I said, the gesture went a long way.\\n It was a reminder that as angry as I was about what was being forced upon me, overall, many of the teachers at the school treated us with respect and kept their politics to themselves.\\n\\n Although I was well on my way to becoming a staunch conservative when I entered high school, the last few years of my education fiercely cemented those beliefs.\\n I fear though, for those who do not recognize when they are being manipulated by the liberal agenda that many schools, public and private, are forcing on the students.\\n\\n As I remember the fractures that were inevitable among the students, when the administration created different identity groups that largely did not exist before their insistence, a phrase comes to mind.\\n The colonies dealt with their differences and shared a common identity: being American.\\n It points fingers at one group, while telling another that the difficulties in their lives are not only beyond their control, but are the fault of others.\\n\\n\\n Losing GOP Support for 2024 Run as Jan. 6 Hearings Unfold: Poll\\nBy.\\n Jason Lemon.\\n On 7\\n22\\n22 at 9:32 AM

President Donald Trump appears to be losing support among Republican voters for a 2024 White House bid as the public hearings of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack against the U.S. Capitol have unfolded, new polling suggests.\\n Trump has not officially confirmed that he plans to seek another presidential term but has repeatedly hinted at the idea as a strong possibility.\\n While polls have generally shown the former president as the clear frontrunner for the Republican Party\\'s nomination, his viability might be taking a hit as the January 6 hearings feature what many view as damning testimony by his own former administration officials and other Republicans.\\n Polling data by Reuters\\nIpsos released on Thursday shows that Trump is losing support among GOP voters for a 2024 presidential run.\\n Survey data collected from July 20 to 21 showed that about one\\nthird (32 percent) of Republicans \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" agreed with the statement that Trump \"should NOT run for president again in 2024.\"\\n That was an increase from about one\\nquarter (26 percent) who said the same just six weeks ago.\\n\\n Former President Donald Trump appears to be losing support among GOP voters for another White House bid, according to new polling.\\n Above, Trump speaks during a Save America rally in Anchorage, Alaska, on July 9, 2022..\\n Additionally, in the previous early\\nJune poll, 51 percent of Republicans \"strongly\" disagreed with the statement that Trump shouldn\\'t seek another term.\\n That level of strong disapproval with the statement dipped 10 points to 41 percent in the latest survey.\\n Relatedly, the level of Republicans who believe Trump is at least partially responsible for January 6 has increased as well.\\n In June, one\\nthird (33 percent) \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" agreed with the statement that the former president is at least \"partly to blame for starting\" the Capitol riot.\\n In July, that amount has increased to 40 percent.\\n Among GOP respondents to the July survey, 9 percent said Trump was \"fully\" responsible for January 6, while 15 percent said \"largely\" and 29 percent said \"partially.\"\\n At the same time, a majority of Republicans still expressed belief in Trump\\'s misinformation, with 55 percent saying that they \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" agree that the 2020 election was stolen.\\n However, that level has gone down 11 points in six weeks.\\n\\n Read more.\\n Pence\\'s Chances of Beating Trump in 2024 as They Face Off in Arizona: Polls.\\n Trump Still

Account\\nLogout.\\n Fact Check.\\n Did John Lennon Say \\'Ringo Wasn\\'t Even the Best Drummer in the Beatles\\'?\\n\\n This was one of the more famous quotes about a Beatle..David Mikkelson.\\n Published Oct 30, 2019\\n7th July 1964:.British drummer Ringo Starr of The Beatles in London on his 24th birthday..\\n Powered By.10.Yes.the Direction of a Ceiling Fan s Rotation Matters in Summer vs.WinterShareNextStay.\\n Claim:.John Lennon once asserted that Ringo Starr \"wasn\\'t even the best drummer in the Beatles.\".\\n Rating:.Misattributed.\\n About this rating.\\n During the height of Beatlemania in the mid\\n1960s, debates about the virtues of individual members of the Fab Four tended to take place among their young female fans, who focused on questions such which Beatle was the cutest, the funniest, or would make the best husband.\\n\\n As the Beatles made the transition from teenage idols to pop music legends, debates about the individual members shifted to more substantive matters, such as pondering which one was the best singer or best songwriter or best instrumentalist.\\n\\n https:\\nyoutu.be\\nb5rpAqfd35Q\\nIn the \"best instrumentalist\" category, arguments over Ringo Starr\\'s drumming prowess were often polarized between two camps: those who believed Ringo to be one of the best rock drummers ever, and those who viewed him as an ordinary talent (at best) who lucked out in being tapped to join a group of three vastly superior musicians.\\n Proponents of the latter viewpoint often cited a purported quote from John Lennon himself in which Lennon supposedly scoffed at the notion of Ringo as the best drummer of all time, quipping: \"The best drummer in the world?\\n Ringo wasn’t even the best drummer in the Beatles!\\n \"\\nIt\\'s unlikely Lennon would ever have said such a thing and meant it seriously, as he — along with the other Beatles — typically spoke fondly and positively of Ringo, both as a person and as a drummer.\\n In the famous Playboy interview conducted just a few months before his murder in 1980, for example, Lennon responded as follows when asked for his opinion of Ringo\\'s musicianship:Advertisement:\\nPLAYBOY: \"Let\\'s move on to Ringo.\\n What\\'s your opinion of him musically?\"\\nLENNON:\\n \"Ringo was a star in his own right in Liverpool before we even met.\\n He was a professional drummer who sang and performed and had Ringo Starr\\ntime, and he was in one of the top groups in Britain but especially in Liverpool before we even had a drummer.\\n So Ringo\\'s talent would have come out one way or the other as something or other.\\n I don\\'t know what he would have ended up as, but whatever that spark is in Ringo that we all know but can\\'t put our finger on ... whether it is acting, drumming or singing, I don\\'t know ...\\n there is something in him that is projectable and he would have surfaced with or without the Beatles.\\n Ringo is a damn good drummer.\\n He is not technically good, but I think Ringo\\'s drumming is underrated the same way Paul\\'s bass playing is underrated ...\\n I think Paul and Ringo stand up with any of the rock musicians.\\n\\n Those who have tried to run the alleged criticism of Lennon\\'s to ground have found it to be sourceless, something that has not turned up in any known audio recording, interview transcript, or primary reporting on Lennon and the Beatles, as renowned Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn noted in an interview with the Los Angeles Times:\\nAs part of his in\\ndepth research, Lewisohn also has debunked a humorous knock on Starr’s drumming abilities, long attributed to John Lennon.\\n For decades, people and media outlets have repeated the anecdote about Lennon being asked whether he considered Starr to be the best drummer in the world.\\n The oft\\nquoted response: “He’s not even the best drummer in the Beatles.”\\nWhile it sounds like the kind of acerbic comment that might have come out of Lennon’s mouth, Lewisohn says no.\\n\\n “The London Times newspaper quoted John Lennon ‘famously saying that Ringo wasn’t even the best drummer in the Beatles.’\\n John Lennon never said that, famously or otherwise, and that is the London Times quoting him,” Lewisohn said, making a point about his motivation for trying to separate fact from Fab Four mythology.\\n\\n he said.\\n “I determined to get to the bottom of it ...\\n John Lennon never said it \\n and wouldn’t have said it.”\\n\\n Those who have sought the true origins of this quip have commonly attributed it to a 1983 television appearance by British comedian Jasper Carrott.\\n Covers the page.\\n Report ad\\nThank you for letting us know.\\n\\n\\n \\nDemocrats mull how much to build back, and when, in budget bill.\\n PoliticsCampaignsCongressWhite

with pieces he previously supportedSen. Edward J. Markey, D\\nMass., argues climate provisions Democrats largely reached consensus on during negotiations last year should serve as the basis for the latest iteration of the party\\'s budget package..\\n (Tom Williams\\nCQ Roll Call file photo)By Lindsey McPherson and Laura WeissPosted January 28, 2022 at 12:25pmDemocrats eager to enact some form of their climate and safety net package before the November midterm elections are floating disparate strategies for resurrecting negotiations West Virginia centrist Sen. Joe Manchin III squashed last month.\\n Manchin suggests “starting from scratch,” but his Democratic colleagues don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater.\\n Democrats have different views on how much of the House\\npassed $2.2 trillion package is salvageable and how long they should negotiate with Manchin after protracted talks last year led nowhere.\\n President Joe Biden said in a press conference last week he’s “confident” some pieces of the existing package will become law before the midterms, citing more than $500 billion in clean energy spending and tax incentives and funding for universal pre\\nkindergarten as examples of provisions that have broad support, including from Manchin.\\n But Biden said he’s “not sure” a renewal of the expired child tax credit expansion providing monthly checks to families of up to $300 per child will remain in the next iteration given Manchin’s opposition to the current structure.\\n “I think we can break the package up, get as much as we can now, and come back and fight for the rest later,” he said.\\n Most Democrats agree with Biden’s general strategy, but there are different factions forming around what’s actually doable now when it comes to the sweeping budget bill they\\'ve dubbed \"Build Back Better.\"Sen.\\n Edward J. Markey, D\\nMass., said in a statement last week that Democrats should start with the climate and clean energy provisions because those “have been largely worked through and financed” to win Manchin’s approval.\\n Other Democrats agree the climate provisions should serve as the basis of the package and any others that can get 50 votes can be added in.\\n Since saying he wanted to start negotiations from scratch, the climate provisions are the only piece of the package Manchin has reiterated he could support.\\n “I think that there’s a lot of areas in climate that we agree,” he said in an interview with Newsy on Wednesday.\\n Child credit coalitionAnother group of senators still wants to build the package around the expanded child tax credit, despite Manchin\\'s argument that the benefit should be further restricted based on income and work requirements.\\n \"West\\n Virginians basically that make $75,000 or less should be the highest priority we have,\" Manchin said Thursday on Talkline with Hoppy Kercheval, a local radio show.\\n Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Ron Wyden of Oregon sent a letter Wednesday to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris requesting it be “a centerpiece of the legislation.\\n ”“The expanded CTC is a signature domestic policy achievement of this administration, and has been an overwhelming success,” the senators wrote, warning of “dire” consequences for failing to extend it.\\n “Without the expanded credit, nearly 10 million children will be thrown back into or deeper into poverty this winter.\\n ”While\\n many Democrats wax optimistic about striking a deal with Manchin on the child tax credit, others acknowledge it may not be feasible, especially with the party looking to pass something soon before election year politics further complicate negotiations.\\n “We think that the child tax credit is very, very important.\\n It doesn’t have 51 votes though,” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer said Tuesday in a Politico Playbook interview.\\n “We have to look at what we can get, not what we’d like to get.”Although\\n there’s no deadline for advancing a revised package, Hoyer urged the Senate to move quickly.\\n “The component parts that I think there is consensus on, let’s pass those, let’s get them done,” the Maryland Democrat said.\\n Lawmakers are trying to negotiate an omnibus appropriations deal before stopgap funding expires Feb. 18; reach agreement on legislation designed to resolve supply chain issues and boost U.S. competitiveness with China; pass sanctions to deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine; and advance a Supreme Court nomination through the Senate.\\'Act without dragging\\'In a Monday Twitter thread, Sen. Tina Smith, D\\nMinn., acknowledged her colleagues’ frustration but urged them to listen to what Manchin has said and “act without dragging this out.\\n ”“I’ve been in [sic] involved in complicated negotiations for a long time, and one thing I’ve learned is you have to know when to take no for an answer.\\n And also when to hear yes and take it,” she said.\\n Build Back Better is no exception..\\n Here are my thoughts.\\n [Thread]— Senator Tina Smith (@SenTinaSmith) January 24, 2022.Congressional Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal acknowledged in a CNN interview last week that the House tried to push Manchin too far by adding things to the package he did not support, like paid leave.\\n The Washington Democrat thinks it’s possible to get a deal “very close to” the $1.75 trillion framework the White House released last fall after extensive negotiations with Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D\\nAriz.“That was Sen. Manchin’s plan,” Jayapal said.\\n “We gave him the pen.\\n And we said, ‘OK, you write it.’”Manchin\\n never endorsed the framework, and he criticized parts of it, like the one\\nyear extension of the child tax credit and funding for Medicare to cover hearing benefits.\\n Several Democrats say Manchin needs to be more clear about what he supports, not just what he opposes, before negotiations can advance.\\n Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders, I\\nVt., has called on Democrats to end backroom negotiations and bring the debate to the Senate floor.\\n He reasons that voting on the package and individual elements of it will show the American people Republicans are obstructing popular policy changes, as well as clarify which aspects Manchin will support.\\n \\'SALT\\' sagaAppeasing Manchin is the primary obstacle to a deal, but there are other intraparty disputes Democrats have to navigate to ensure a revised package can get to Biden’s desk.\\n Chief among them is whether to provide some relief from a Republican\\nenacted $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction.\\n It’s a top priority for Democrats from high\\ntax states like New Jersey, New York and California, but progressives from lower tax states are reluctant to provide a tax break that disproportionately benefits the wealthy.\\n Sen. Bob Menendez, D\\nN.J., and Sanders sought to negotiate a compromise that could pass the Senate but those talks paused as the package stalled.\\n Their cooperation appeared to end Wednesday after The Hill reported that no relief would make it into the squeezed bill.\\n Sanders hailed the report on Twitter.\\n Menendez hit back in his own tweet, implying Sanders had reversed himself from comments he made in the fall calling the cap “a regressive and unfair proposal.\\n And this Congress must rectify it.”Menendez\\n also said in a statement that “SALT remains high in my list of priorities.”\\n While he didn’t say whether a final version must address the SALT cap to get his vote, a trio of House Democrats have.\\n “If there are any efforts that include a change in the tax code, then a SALT fix must be part of it,” New York Rep. Tom Suozzi and New Jersey Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill said in a joint statement last week.\\n “No SALT, no deal.\\n that needle is difficult since Democrats have zero votes to spare in the Senate and only four in the House amid universal GOP opposition.\\n Only one Democrat, Maine’s Jared Golden, voted against the House package, but his primary complaint was the SALT cap increase, so he could switch positions if it’s left untouched.\\n There are other pockets of lawmakers whose support for a slimmer package is not guaranteed.\\n That includes a trio of House Democrats who said they would oppose any package that did not provide legal protections for millions of undocumented immigrations, three versions of which the Senate parliamentarian rejected as violating the budget reconciliation rules.\\n The six\\nmember progressive “squad” that voted against the bipartisan infrastructure bill because they wanted to hold it as leverage for Manchin to support a bigger reconciliation package may be reluctant to accept further cuts.\\n Hoyer predicts enough of those members will ultimately support whatever can get through the Senate.\\n “It’s the art of the possible.\\n Legislating is not perfect,” he said.\\n “You can’t make the perfect the enemy of the good \\n a hackneyed statement but an absolute true one.”The\\n Source for news on Capitol Hill since 1955AboutContact UsAdvertiseEventsPrivacyRC JobsNewslettersThe StaffSubscriptionsCQ Roll Call is a part of FiscalNote, the leading technology innovator at the intersection of global business and government.\\n\\n \\n\\n Did Police Make Disturbing Find of \\'Obama\\'s Muslim Refugees\\' in a Minnesota Olive Garden? \\n \\n Snopes.com\\nBecome a Member\\nSearch\\nMy Account\\nLogout\\nContact Us\\nLatest\\nTop\\nFact Checks\\nCollections\\nNews\\nArchives\\nAbout Us\\nRandomizer\\nBecome a Member\\nLogin\\nMy Account\\nLogout.\\n Fact Check.\\n Did Police Make Disturbing Find of \\'Obama\\'s Muslim Refugees\\' in a Minnesota Olive Garden?\\n\\n A blog with a misleading headline falsely reported that Rochester, Minnesota police found Muslim refugees doing something \"disturbing\" after raiding an Olive Garden restaurant..Bethania Palma.\\n Published May 8, 2017\\nImage Via ljh images \\n Shutterstock.com.\\n Advertisment:\\nClaim:.Police raided an Olive Garden and made a \"disturbing find\" thanks to Obama\\'s Muslim refugees..Rating:.False.\\n About this rating.\\n In early May 2017, far\\nright blog FreedomDaily.com posted a story with a misleading headline reporting that Rochester, Minnesota police had raided an Olive Garden restaurant \"where Obama’s Muslim refugees were\", only to make a\"DISTURBING find inside\":\\nThe Olive Garden is arguably one of America’s most beloved restaurant chains for their delicious dishes and comfortable family environment.\\n However, when Barack Obama’s Muslim refugees take over one of these eateries, it becomes the last place you ever want to be caught dining, and probably make you hate pasta for the rest of your life.\\n This is especially the case at one popular location that became customers’ worst nightmare after cops raided it and made a disturbing find inside.\\n ...\\n\\n Although there were three Muslim men who participated in the brutal lunch hour exchange of gunfire, one two have been caught and charged.\\n The third got away with it and is likely being harbored by fellow refugees until the urge to kill strikes again — which is only a matter of time.\\n\\n Rochester police Capt.

— but then Cruz began passing out memos entitled “Path to ‘Yes,’” which detailed the four concessions required from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to earn Cruz’s vote.\\n The most significant of those points, a consumer\\nfreedom option allowing insurance companies to sell non\\nObamacare\\ncompliant plans so long as they sell at least one Obamacare\\ncompliant plan as well, may actually be coming to fruition..\\n As reported by Vox’s Dylan Scott, Cruz has not yet shared a written amendment, but he has begun to negotiate the proposal with an increasingly desperate McConnell, who cannot afford to lose the votes of Cruz, Paul, Lee, Johnson, and a few undecideds if Susan Collins and Dean Heller vote no.\\n (Because the BCRA is a reconciliation bill and cannot be filibustered, it needs only 50 votes in the Senate plus a tie\\nbreaker from Vice President Mike Pence.\\n But there are just 52 Senate Republicans.)\\n In short, Cruz is fighting for a parallel market of unregulated insurance plans alongside Obamacare plans, which will remain subsidized via the BCRA’s $50 billion bailout so as to avoid an immediate death spiral..\\n Cruz’s proposal is not just politically necessary, but also a vital and wildly relieving return to conservative policymaking that lowers prices and increases coverage by inducing supply rather than demand.\\n The return of high\\ndeductible, low\\npremium plans will bring young people back into the market without completely abandoning the few popular Obamacare provisions that gave older, sicker Americans better access to health care.\\n The relaxation of regulations, though partial, will encourage more insurers to enter the market, increasing supply and bringing down premiums, at least in theory.\\n\\n Obamacare coerced Americans to purchase insurance from an already small number of providers, and then tacked on more regulations so only the largest providers stayed in the market — resulting in an effective cartel or monopoly, depending on the county.\\n This did reduce the number of Americans without insurance, but at the price of risk pools depleted of young, healthy people to share in the costs of unhealthier people, Medicare reimbursement rates slashed for physicians (a threat to health\\ncare supply because such cuts reduce the returns to doctors’ labor), and skyrocketing premiums..\\n Without McConnell\\xa0making this concession, the BCRA is a series of tax cuts reversing Obamacare’s economic redistributionism, a bailout for the Obamacare exchanges, and a Medicaid reform that will happen only if the Republican party can stay in power for the next decade to see the defunding through.\\n For taxes and federal spending, the BCRA would be good in its current form, but it would not fix the fundamental problems with Obamacare.\\n It may halt the death spiral or alter the trajectory of premiums over the next decade, but it would still mostly fail to attract more insurers and more plans into the marketplace..\\n Cruz may have filled the vital role of principled conservative and, strikingly, the compromiser of the Senate.\\n\\n Given recent reports that McConnell will increase opioid\\naddiction funding and further reduce Health Savings Account regulations, he seems ready to play to win over the last, necessary holdouts.\\n McConnell is hardly an ideological visionary, but he is a master whip.\\n Cruz may have filled the vital role of principled conservative and, strikingly, the compromiser of the Senate.\\n\\n The Republicans have not yet abandoned the teleological notion that the role of government is to maximize the amount of Americans insured, but Cruz’s proposal marks a pointed departure from the type of thinking that has plagued the GOP since assuming the presidency.\\n And perhaps, this success for capitalism would take us one step closer to finally achieving a free market for all.\\n\\n READ MORE:\\nTed Cruz: Health\\nCare Reform

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton gave a stern and straightforward response during a 2014 CNN interview about how she thought the country\\'s immigration laws should be executed, particularly when it came to children of undocumented immigrants, according to Mediaite.\\n In the exchange with CNN host and reporter Christiane Amanpour, Clinton was not speaking specifically about \"dreamers,\" children who were brought to the United States by their parents and until recently have been allowed to remain and work in the country, but children who were coming along borders on their own.\\n \"We have to send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn\\'t mean the child gets to stay,\" the former secretary of state said.\\n \"So, we don\\'t want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey.\\n \"Amanpour then asked: \"So, you\\'re saying they should be sent back now?Newsweek Newsletter sign\\nup >Related Stories\\nBernie Sanders on Colbert: Trump, Hillary and Medicare\"Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back,\" Clinton responded.\\n \"But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families.\"Before\\n that exchange, Clinton explained that an increase in immigration at that time had to do with violence in some Central American countries and authorities there being unable to properly curtail it.\\n At the time, Clinton was promoting her book Hard Choices, and she was not too far away from announcing her bid for the 2016 presidential race.\\n And the report notes that while on the campaign trail Clinton said she wanted \"comprehensive immigration\" reform and would also \"fight to protect\" immigrants covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans acts ordered under President Barack Obama.\\n The latter was enacted—while DAPA was struck down in federal court—but President Donald Trump\\'s administration announced Wednesday that the program would be nixed.\\n Trump did, though, state that he \"loved\" the 800,000 so\\ncalled Dreamers and hoped Congress would take action in protecting them from possible deportation.\\n Newsweek

go down as a president.”\\xa0\\n “Well, I lifted the ban on Cuban cigars, that’s something,” Mr. Obama quipped in response, referring to the lifting of the U.S.\\nCuban trade embargo.\\n Another compared him to the “Sharknado” movies.\\n Obama is the ‘Sharknado’ of presidents \\n loud, stupid and overhyped,” he read.\\xa0\\n Mr. Obama, a big sports fan, was asked if he was happy that the Chicago Cubs were going to the World Series.\\n Mr. Obama appeared to have some trouble getting “yes” out.\\n\\n “To see just how happy everybody was, I actually felt pretty good.\\n Comedian Bill

Obama said.\\n the high pressures of the presidency, Mr. Obama admitted it’s rare for aides to wake him up in the middle of the night.\\n The most serious problems are usually anticipated.\\n He used the question to take another dig at Trump, saying “What I don’t do at 3 a.m., I don’t tweet about people who insulted me.”Kimmel\\n then asked Obama if he ever laughed during the debates when watching

Supporters?\\n\\n Hot mic videos are always popular, but not always accurate..Dan Evon.\\n Advertisment:\\nClaim:.A video shows U.S. President Donald Trump calling his supporters \"animals\" who shoot \"Mountain Dew in their veins\" while watching \"\\'Tiger King\\' for the 45th time,\" among other insults..Rating:.False.\\n About this rating.\\n In July 2020, a video supposedly showing U.S. President Donald Trump denigrating his supporters was widely circulated on social media:.The visuals in this footage are genuine, but the audio has been manipulated.\\n It should also be noted that it doesn\\'t appear that Project Veritas, a right\\nwing activist group that has published several controversial and misleading undercover videos, had anything to do with this video..\\n The above\\ndisplayed video was created using real footage of Trump as he toured the FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies\\' Innovation Center in Morrisville, North Carolina, on July 27 after the company announced that they would be aiding the effort to develop a COVID\\n19 vaccine.\\n In the original video from CBS 17, it\\'s difficult to make out exactly what is being said due to background noise.\\n However, it\\'s clear that during this portion of the tour, Trump was doing more listening than speaking..\\n Here\\'s the original video.\\n The scene shown in the viral video begins around the 45\\nsecond mark:.The genuine video shows Trump listening as others (presumably) talk about FUJIFILM\\'s work.\\n The viral video featured doctored audio added to this footage to make it appear as if Trump was insulting his supporters..Sources.\\n Boburg, Shawn; Davis, Aaron; Crites, Alice..\"A Woman Approached The Post With Dramatic — and False — Tale About Roy Moore.\\n She Appears to be Part

Urbana\\nChampaign, somebody (still anonymous at this point, apparently) put up a Facebook page announcing the proposed formation of a White Student Union which purports to specifically counter the activities of Black Lives Matter demonstrations on campus.\\n Trending: Elderly AZ Rancher Charged With First Degree Murder For Shooting A Mexican Man Caught On His Property\\n Who Has Already Been Deported Multiple Times.\\n A Facebook page ostensibly created for an audience at the University of Illinois at Urbana\\nChampaign called “Illini White Students Union” has drawn fire after it characterized the national Black Lives Matter movement as “terrorism.”\\n\\n Created Wednesday after a protest sympathetic to Black Lives\\n Matter, the page declared itself “for white students of University of Illinois to be able to form a community and discuss our own issues as well as be able to organize against the terrorism we have been facing from Black Lives Matter activists on campus,” as the Daily Illini reported..\\n (100 Percent Fed Up benefits when you use this promo code.).Click HERE to see the Facebook page.\\n\\n The page did not last long in its original incarnation, but was taken down after three hours.\\n It has since been revived here.\\n\\n First, it’s important to note that as long as the author or authors remain anonymous and don’t come forward with an actual proposal on campus, this may all be vaporware.\\n But with that said, it might also light off a discussion of the bizarre constructs of racism and perceived racism on America’s college campuses as well as the limits of free speech and tolerance.\\n The conversation – if it takes place – is likely to be fairly one sided.\\n The university already weighed in with their official line, as put forward by campus spokeswoman Robin Kaler.\\n\\n “It is disturbing and cowardly that someone would create an anonymous and senseless social media page specifically designed to intimidate others, including and especially our students.\\n When we became aware of the page, we immediately contacted Facebook and requested that it be removed,” Kaler said in an email.\\n “Facebook has been responsive to our requests, but the page continues to be reposted.\\n We are continuing to work with Facebook to address this matter.\\n We recognize that passions run deep on all sides of many issues, but actions like this are senseless and hurtful and do nothing to foster meaningful dialogue.”\\n\\n Meanwhile, here are some of the racist and threatening tweets that were posted to the\\xa0Office of Inclusion & Intercultural Relations, University Of Illinois Urbana Champagne twitter page, supposedly featuring scenes from their protests:\\n“Expect Resistance”.\\n UIUC ✊🏿

November 18, 2015\\nFind Out More >70,468.Yeah…but those darn White kids…\\nIs there a need for some sort of White Student Union?\\n I’m sure we could have a debate about that which would drag on for years.\\n In a more existential sense, one might argue that there are problems unique to white students, such as quota systems which undermine merit based acceptance rates or the availability of certain grants and loan programs which are race based and exclude large numbers of people from consideration.\\n But on a day to day basis, complaining that white students are somehow discriminated against by university policy is a bit of a stretch and could set such a hypothetical student union up for ridicule, if not failure, because of the accepted conventional wisdom.\\n\\n But that’s really the point here, isn’t it?\\n Even if you’re making the argument that “it’s simply not needed” then you have to show us why that’s a disqualifying factor.\\n A football team isn’t “needed” either if the goal of a university is to educate young minds and prepare them for the adult world, but pretty much every college in America has one.\\n\\n Then there’s the question of Black Lives Matter, which seemed to spur this proposal whether it be fake or real.\\n The creators of the supposed White Student Union overplay their hand considerably when their opening gambit is to label BLM as “terrorists” but the underlying text voices complaints about constant disruptions to studies and the normal affairs of campus life.\\n Is that an unreasonable charge?\\n As we’ve seen with BLM protests all over the country, their primary goal is disruption of white spaces.\\n (Their phrasing, not mine.)\\n\\n The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy.\\n Try again in a few moments.\\n If you are

Zac Lois, known as the underground railroad\\'s “engineer.”The\\n Afghan operators, assets, interpreters and their families were known as “passengers” and they were being guided remotely by “shepherds,\" who are, in most cases their loyal former U.S. special operations forces and CIA comrades and commanders, according to chat room communications viewed by ABC News.\\n Refugees are evacuated from Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan on, Aug. 26, 2021.Hassan\\n Majeed\\nUPI\\nShutterstockThere was one engineer, a few conductors, as well as people who were performing intelligence\\ngathering duties.\\n The intelligence was pooled in the encrypted chat group in real\\ntime and included guiding people on maps to GPS pin drops at rally points for them to stage in the shadows and in hiding until summoned by a conductor wearing a green chem light, ABC News observed in the encrypted chat.\\n Once summoned, passengers would hold up their smartphones with a graphic of yellow pineapples on a pink field.\\n Before the deadly ISIS\\nK bombing on Thursday near the Abbey Gate of the airport known as HKIA, intelligence warnings were issued about possible improvised explosive device attacks by ISIS\\nK.\\n MORE: Biden vows retribution on terrorists who killed 13 US service members in Kabul\"We have lost comms with several of our teams,\" texted Jason Redman, a combat\\nwounded former Navy SEAL and author, who was shepherding Afghans he knew.\\n There was concern the Taliban had dropped the cell towers \\n but another Task Force Pineapple member, a Green Beret, reported that he learned the U.S. military had employed cell phone jammers to counter the IED threat at Abbey gate.\\n Within an hour, most had reestablished communications with the \"passengers\" and the slow, deliberate movements of each group resumed under the ticking clock of sunrise in Kabul, ABC News observed in the encrypted chat.\\n An all\\nvolunteer group of American veterans of the Afghan war launched a daring mission on Wednesday night dubbed the \"Pineapple Express\" to shepherd critically at\\nrisk Afghan elite forces and...Show more \\nShow\\n moreCourtesy Capt.
