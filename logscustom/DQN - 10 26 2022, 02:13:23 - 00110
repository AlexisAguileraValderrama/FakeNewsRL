members said 2016 is the year for Ryan to prove himself.\n', 'Sending a repeal of the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) to the president, as the House did Wednesday evening, is only a start.\n', 'Ryan "needs to start putting up real conservative reform in the House and doing the things that are necessary to show the voters that he is a different speaker than [Ryan\'s predecessor]\n', 'John

because it\'s terrible."But\n', 'Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie said that the true yardstick for Ryan and House Republicans this year is the process by which Congress exercises its so\ncalled

plan to replace Obamacare, overhaul the tax code and reform welfare.\n', 'A few of the conservatives also raised the issue of criminal justice reform, which Massie linked to the armed standoff playing out in Oregon over federal land rights.\n', '"We could blame the court" that sentenced two men to lengthy jail terms over land use violations, but he suggested sentencing guidelines were at fault,
